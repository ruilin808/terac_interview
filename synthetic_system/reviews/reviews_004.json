      "title": "A Culinary Game-Changer for the Busy Professional! Seriously Impressed.",
      "review_text": "As a busy marketing professional living in a small apartment, cooking often feels like a chore, and healthy eating can easily take a backseat to takeout. I've heard the buzz about air fryers for years, but always dismissed them as just another gadget. However, after one too many soggy oven fries and the constant desire for healthier, quick meals, I finally decided to invest in the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, and I can confidently say it has revolutionized my kitchen routine. First off, the design is sleek and surprisingly compact for its 5.8QT capacity. It fits neatly on my limited counter space without looking like a bulky appliance. My initial setup was a breeze \u2013 a quick wipe down, a test run as per the manual, and I was ready to go. The digital interface is intuitive; I particularly love the pre-programmed settings for common items like fries, chicken, and steak. This is a huge time-saver when I'm tired after work and don't want to fiddle with temperatures and timings. The performance is where this machine truly shines. My first experiment was homemade sweet potato fries. They came out perfectly crispy on the outside and wonderfully tender on the inside, with just a tablespoon of oil \u2013 a stark contrast to the greasy, limp versions I used to make in the oven. Chicken breasts, which often dry out in my conventional oven, emerge incredibly juicy with a beautiful golden crust. I've even ventured into roasting vegetables, and Brussels sprouts have never tasted so good; they get that perfect charred crispiness without being overcooked. Reheating leftovers is another area where it excels \u2013 pizza slices get their crisp base back, and spring rolls taste fresh out of the fryer. The 5.8QT capacity is ideal for me as a single person, or for cooking for two. I can easily fit two good-sized chicken breasts, a batch of fries, or a generous portion of vegetables. Cleaning is surprisingly easy too; the non-stick basket and crisper plate usually just need a quick wash with soap and water, or can go into the dishwasher. This is a significant plus, as I detest scrubbing. While overwhelmingly positive, I do have a minor nitpick. The \"Pro II\" in its name made me hope for some app connectivity or smart features, which this particular model lacks. It's purely a manual digital interface, which works perfectly fine, but for a \"Pro II\" series, I envisioned something more connected. Also, it can be a little noisy when running at full power, a bit like a powerful fan, but it's not overly disruptive. These are minor points compared to the sheer convenience, health benefits, and delicious results it consistently delivers. For anyone looking to eat healthier, save time in the kitchen, and enjoy incredibly tasty, crispy food without excessive oil, the COSORI Pro II is an absolute must-have. It's more than just an air fryer; it's become my go-to kitchen appliance.",

      "title": "Great Performance, A Few Quibbles \u2013 My Go-To for Weeknight Dinners",
      "review_text": "Our family of four (two adults, two school-aged kids) leads a pretty hectic life, so anything that makes dinner prep quicker and healthier is a win in my book. We bought the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, primarily to cut down on frying oil and get those crispy textures my kids love without the mess and guilt. After several months of heavy use, it has definitely earned its spot on our countertop, though it\u2019s not without its minor imperfections. The cooking performance is, without a doubt, excellent. Chicken nuggets, fish sticks, and fries come out perfectly golden and crisp, far superior to anything from our conventional oven and much healthier than deep-frying. I've also experimented with things like roasted salmon, which comes out beautifully flaky and moist, and even some small batches of cookies that developed a lovely crust. Reheating pizza in this thing is transformative; it brings back that fresh-out-of-the-box crispness that microwaves just obliterate. The hot air circulation genuinely works its magic, delivering consistent results once you get the hang of it. The 5.8QT capacity is *just* enough for our family of four if we're cooking a side dish or a main course like chicken thighs. For things like fries, I often have to do two batches to ensure they get enough space to crisp up properly, which adds a bit of time to the overall meal prep. This is a common air fryer issue, but it's something to consider for larger families. The digital controls are straightforward, and the presets are a good starting point, though I often adjust the time and temperature based on my preferences and specific food thickness. My main criticisms revolve around a few design choices. Firstly, while the non-stick coating on the basket and crisper plate is great for preventing sticking, cleaning around the edges of the crisper plate can be a bit fiddly. Food bits tend to get caught in the crevices, requiring a brush or careful scrubbing. Secondly, the overall build feels solid, but the plastic casing does attract fingerprints easily, requiring frequent wiping to keep it looking tidy. Lastly, and this is a minor one, the cord length is a bit short for my kitchen layout, limiting where I can place it. Despite these minor drawbacks, the COSORI Pro II has significantly reduced our oven usage, especially during warmer months, and helped us incorporate healthier versions of our favorite \"fried\" foods. It's dependable, produces delicious results, and the convenience factor for quick meals is immense. It's a solid 4-star product that delivers on most of its promises and has definitely made our dinner routine smoother. If you\u2019re a family of three or four and looking for a reliable air fryer, this is a strong contender, just be prepared for occasional batch cooking and a slightly particular cleaning routine.",

      "title": "Decent Air Fryer, But Not the \"Pro II\" Upgrade I Hoped For",
      "review_text": "I purchased the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, as an upgrade from a smaller, entry-level air fryer I'd been using for a couple of years. My hope was for increased capacity, more advanced features, and an overall more robust cooking experience. While it delivers on capacity and certain aspects, it falls a bit short of the \"Pro II\" designation and my expectations for a truly superior appliance. On the positive side, the 5.8QT capacity is definitely an improvement. I can now cook a full rack of ribs (cut into sections) or a larger batch of wings without overcrowding, which helps with even cooking. When it works well, it produces some really good results \u2013 crispy fries, perfectly cooked chicken tenders, and surprisingly good roasted vegetables with minimal oil. The digital interface is easy enough to navigate, and the presets are a decent starting point for common dishes, although I find myself often tweaking them significantly. The non-stick coating on the basket and crisper plate generally makes cleaning straightforward, which is always a plus in a busy kitchen. However, where it starts to lose its luster is in consistency and perceived \"pro\" features. Despite its name, this model lacks the smart connectivity (app control, recipe integration) that many other \"Pro\" labeled air fryers, even from Cosori, offer. This felt like a misstep or a marketing oversight, as I was expecting more smart capabilities. Furthermore, I\u2019ve noticed some inconsistency in cooking, especially with larger batches. Even with careful shaking and turning, I sometimes find hot spots that overcook certain parts while others remain undercooked. This requires more vigilance and manual intervention than I\u2019d like from a supposed \"Pro\" model. Another issue is the noise level; it's noticeably louder than my previous smaller air fryer, which can be a bit disruptive in an open-plan living space. While not unbearable, it's something to consider. The overall build quality, while decent, doesn't quite scream \"premium.\" The plastic housing feels a little less robust than I'd anticipated for the price point, and I'm a bit concerned about its long-term durability. In essence, the COSORI Pro II is a functional air fryer that gets the job done for medium-sized meals and delivers good results *most* of the time. But it doesn't offer the significant leap in technology or consistent performance that its name implies, nor does it feel like a substantial upgrade over cheaper, simpler models beyond raw capacity. It's a good air fryer, but not a great one, and certainly not \"Pro II\" in the sense I was hoping for. For the price, I expected a bit more polish and consistent performance.",

      "title": "Disappointing Durability and Inconsistent Heating \u2013 Not Worth the Investment",
      "review_text": "I bought the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, about six months ago, hoping it would be a reliable workhorse for my small family. I was excited by the positive reviews and the promise of healthy, crispy meals. Unfortunately, my experience has been largely disappointing, primarily due to durability issues and inconsistent heating that make cooking a frustrating gamble. Initially, it performed adequately. We got some good batches of fries and chicken tenders, and the convenience factor was a clear plus. The 5.8QT capacity was just right for our family of three, and the digital controls seemed straightforward enough. However, after about three months, I started noticing problems. The non-stick coating on the crisper plate began to flake off, despite following all care instructions (hand washing with soft sponges, no abrasive cleaners). This is a major concern, both for food safety and the longevity of the product. Flaking non-stick is simply unacceptable for an appliance used daily. Beyond the coating issue, the heating consistency has become a serious problem. Foods that should cook evenly now often have burnt spots on one side while remaining undercooked on the other, even with frequent shaking and flipping. It feels like the heating element or the fan is not distributing hot air properly. This means I have to constantly monitor the food, opening the basket multiple times, which defeats the purpose of the timer and convenience. My chicken is sometimes dry on the outside but still pink inside, and fries can be a mix of charcoal and limpness in the same batch. It's become a guessing game every time I use it. The machine also produces a significant amount of noise, more than I expected, and it seems to have gotten louder over time. The overall build quality, which initially seemed decent, now feels flimsy, especially with the flaking coating. For the price I paid, I expected a product that would last much longer and perform consistently. This unit is definitely not living up to that expectation. I've reached out to customer support regarding the flaking, and while they were polite, the resolution process has been slow and cumbersome, requiring multiple photos and proof of purchase, and I'm still waiting on a satisfactory solution. Given the inconsistent cooking and the rapid deterioration of the non-stick surface, I cannot recommend this air fryer. It's become more of a frustration than a convenience, and I regret this purchase. I expected a reliable kitchen appliance, but instead, I got a product with significant quality control issues.",

      "title": "Dangerous Malfunction and Fire Hazard \u2013 A Complete Disaster",
      "review_text": "I am writing this review with immense frustration and a strong warning to others considering the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT. My experience with this product has been nothing short of a complete disaster, culminating in what I believe was a dangerous electrical malfunction and a fire hazard within just two months of purchase. From the very first use, I noticed a strong chemical smell, which I initially dismissed as a \"new appliance\" smell. It persisted, however, and grew stronger. The cooking results were also subpar; chicken often came out rubbery, and fries were inconsistently cooked, often soggy in the middle and burnt on the ends, despite following recommended settings and preheating. The digital display was often unresponsive to touch, requiring multiple presses to register commands, which was a minor annoyance but should have been a red flag. The real problem occurred last week. I was air frying some frozen fish fillets, a routine task I had done several times before. About halfway through the cooking cycle, I heard a loud popping sound followed by a burning plastic smell that quickly intensified. I immediately unplugged the unit, and as I did, I noticed smoke emanating from the back of the appliance near the fan vent. Upon inspection, there was clear evidence of melting plastic inside the vent area, and the appliance felt excessively hot, even after being unplugged for a few minutes. This was incredibly alarming and frankly, terrifying, as it happened right on my kitchen counter. Had I not been in the room, or had the problem escalated, it could have caused a significant kitchen fire. I am utterly appalled by the quality and safety of this product. An appliance, especially one that uses high heat, should not malfunction in such a dangerous way within such a short period. This is not just a performance issue; it's a serious safety concern. I have immediately ceased using the unit and will be disposing of it. My attempts to contact Cosori customer service have been met with long wait times and unhelpful responses, basically asking me to send back the potentially fire-damaged unit, which I'm not comfortable doing without better assurances. I bought this air fryer for convenience and healthier cooking, but instead, it brought me anxiety and a genuine safety scare. I urge potential buyers to consider these serious safety flaws before purchasing. This product, in my experience, is a fire hazard and not fit for purpose. Save your money and invest in a safer, more reliable brand. This COSORI Pro II is a dangerous piece of equipment.",

      "title": "Unbelievable Versatility and Health Benefits \u2013 My Oven Collects Dust Now!",
      "review_text": "Let me preface this by saying I was skeptical. I already have a full-sized oven, a microwave, and a slow cooker. Did I *really* need an air fryer? My spouse convinced me, pointing out the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, promised healthier cooking with less oil and quicker meal times. Fast forward three months, and I genuinely don't know how I cooked without it. My traditional oven now mostly serves as extra counter space or storage for baking sheets \u2013 that's how much I rely on this air fryer. The 5.8QT capacity is perfect for our family of three, and even when we have guests, it handles side dishes or appetizers beautifully. From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by its robust build and user-friendly digital interface. The presets are incredibly helpful for beginners, giving you a solid starting point for various dishes, but the manual temperature and time adjustments allow for full control once you get more confident. The results are consistently phenomenal. Chicken wings? Crispy skin, juicy meat, minimal oil, and done in under 20 minutes. Roasted vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers, asparagus)? They come out perfectly tender-crisp with a slight char that enhances their flavor. Frozen items like spring rolls, mozzarella sticks, and even breakfast burritos are transformed into hot, crispy perfection in minutes. I've even made homemade doughnuts (baked, not fried!) that were surprisingly light and delicious. The key is the powerful hot air circulation, which truly mimics deep-frying texture without all the grease. Cleaning is an absolute breeze. The non-stick basket and crisper plate wipe clean with minimal effort, or they can go straight into the dishwasher. This is a huge time-saver after dinner. The unit's footprint is reasonable for its capacity, fitting comfortably on my countertop without being an eyesore. It's also significantly more energy-efficient than heating up a large conventional oven for smaller meals, which is a nice bonus on our electricity bill. One minor point, if I'm being critical: the fan can be a bit loud when it's running at full tilt, comparable to a powerful range hood. It's not unbearable, but you definitely know it's on. Also, the instruction manual could offer a few more detailed recipe ideas or cooking charts for less common items. However, these are extremely minor quibbles in an otherwise perfect kitchen appliance. This COSORI Pro II isn't just an air fryer; it's a versatile mini-oven that cooks faster, healthier, and with consistently delicious results. It has genuinely simplified my meal prep, making healthy eating more accessible and enjoyable. If you're on the fence, jump off it and get one. You won't regret it.",

      "title": "Solid Performer for Everyday Cooking, Just a Few Minor Design Flaws",
      "review_text": "I purchased the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, about six months ago after my old, smaller air fryer finally gave up the ghost. I was looking for something with a bit more capacity and improved performance, and for the most part, this Cosori unit delivers. It's become an indispensable tool in my kitchen for quick weeknight meals and reheating leftovers. The 5.8QT size is perfect for my partner and me, and even allows for cooking enough for a small dinner party or meal prepping a few portions for the week. I've cooked everything from perfectly roasted chicken thighs with crispy skin, to wonderfully flaky salmon, and of course, the obligatory crispy fries and sweet potato wedges. The circulating hot air does an excellent job of browning and crisping food without drying it out, provided you don't overload the basket. The results are consistently better than my conventional oven for most smaller items, saving both time and energy. The digital display is bright and easy to read, and the pre-programmed settings are a good starting point, especially for those new to air frying. Cleaning is generally easy due to the non-stick coating. The basket and crisper plate slide out smoothly and usually just require a quick rinse and wipe. This is a major plus for me, as I dislike extensive cleanup after cooking. It also heats up incredibly fast, meaning less waiting around compared to a traditional oven. However, there are a few aspects that prevent me from giving it a full 5-star rating. Firstly, while the non-stick coating is effective, it feels a little delicate. I'm always very careful to use only silicone or wooden utensils, but I worry about its long-term durability. Some minor discoloration has already started appearing, though it hasn't affected performance yet. Secondly, the overall aesthetic, while functional, is a bit bland. For a \"Pro II\" model, I expected a slightly more premium look and feel, perhaps some brushed stainless steel accents instead of predominantly plastic. Lastly, the rubber stoppers on the crisper plate, while serving their purpose, can sometimes come loose during washing, which is a minor annoyance. Despite these small complaints, the COSORI Pro II is a reliable, high-performing air fryer that I use almost daily. It's significantly improved our cooking efficiency and allowed us to enjoy healthier versions of our favorite comfort foods. It\u2019s a very strong contender in its category, just with a few areas where design and material choices could be refined to elevate it to a truly perfect appliance. If you're looking for consistent performance and good capacity, this unit is definitely worth considering.",

      "title": "Good Concept, Flawed Execution \u2013 Learning Curve and Durability Concerns",
      "review_text": "As a college student living in a dorm with limited kitchen access, I was really excited about the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT. The idea of being able to cook healthy, crispy meals quickly in my room without a full oven was incredibly appealing. After using it for several months, I have very mixed feelings; it's a good concept, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired, and I'm already questioning its longevity. Let's start with the positives: when it works, it works pretty well. I've managed to make some decent chicken wings, crispy fries (though often in small batches), and even reheated pizza to a surprisingly good texture. The capacity is actually quite good for one or two people, allowing me to cook a main dish and a side simultaneously if I manage the space correctly. The digital controls are relatively straightforward, and I appreciate the range of temperatures it offers. It's also much faster than using the shared dorm kitchen oven, which is a huge convenience. However, the downsides are significant. The biggest issue for me has been the steep learning curve and inconsistent results. Despite following recipes and recommended settings, I frequently find food overcooked on the outside and still cold or undercooked on the inside, especially with thicker items. This requires constant checking, shaking, and adjusting, which takes away from the \"set it and forget it\" convenience I was hoping for. It feels like I'm constantly babysitting it. The circulation doesn't seem as even as advertised. Another major concern is the build quality. The plastic housing feels quite flimsy, and I've noticed some creaking noises when pulling out the basket. More importantly, the non-stick coating on my crisper plate has started showing signs of wear and tear, with small chips appearing, despite being extremely careful and only using silicone utensils and gentle cleaning methods. This is unacceptable for an appliance that's only a few months old and used primarily for simple tasks. I'm worried about the coating flaking into my food. Finally, the noise level is quite high, which can be disruptive in a small dorm room, especially if I'm trying to study or have a conversation. It sounds like a mini jet engine. While it has its moments of delivering good results, the overall experience is marred by the inconsistent cooking, the questionable durability of the non-stick coating, and the constant need for supervision. For the price, I expected more robust construction and a more consistent, user-friendly cooking experience. It's a functional appliance, but not one I would wholeheartedly recommend without significant caveats.",

      "title": "Too Loud, Too Finicky, and Already Showing Signs of Wear After 8 Months",
      "review_text": "I bought the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, about eight months ago, drawn in by the promise of quick, healthy meals and its good capacity. While it has delivered on the \"quick\" part, my overall experience has been quite frustrating, leading me to regret this purchase. It's too loud, too finicky, and frankly, isn't holding up well for the price. Let's start with the noise. This thing is ridiculously loud. It sounds like a jet engine warming up in my kitchen, making conversation difficult and definitely preventing me from using it late at night or early in the morning without disturbing others. I expected some fan noise, but this is excessive. It's easily the loudest appliance I own, including my old, clunky dishwasher. Beyond the noise, the cooking itself has become inconsistent. Initially, it performed okay, but over the past few months, I've noticed a significant decline. Foods often come out either overcooked and dry, or surprisingly soggy, even with careful monitoring and adjustments. I've had chicken nuggets that were perfect on top but still cold on the bottom, requiring me to constantly flip and redistribute, which adds to the cooking time and defeats the purpose of \"quick meals.\" The hot air distribution feels uneven, creating frustrating hot and cold spots. The digital controls, while initially responsive, have also started to become temperamental. The touch buttons sometimes require multiple presses to register, which is annoying when trying to quickly set a time or temperature. It feels like the quality of the internal components isn't holding up. My biggest concern, however, is the durability. After just eight months of moderate use (maybe 3-4 times a week), the non-stick coating on the crisper plate is visibly flaking off in several spots. I've been meticulous with cleaning, only using soft sponges and mild soap, and never metal utensils. This level of wear in such a short period is unacceptable for a product in this price range. It makes me question the safety of continuing to use it if small bits of coating are coming off into my food. Overall, this COSORI air fryer has turned into a source of frustration rather than convenience. The excessive noise, inconsistent cooking, finicky controls, and poor durability of the non-stick coating make it a regrettable purchase. I'm now looking into replacing it with a different brand, as I don't trust this unit to last much longer or to cook my food safely and reliably. It promised a lot but delivered disappointment.",

      "title": "Failed Completely After 4 Months \u2013 Zero Reliability, Poor Support",
      "review_text": "I am incredibly disappointed with the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT. I purchased it four months ago, excited by the prospect of healthier meals and the convenience air fryers offer. For the first few weeks, it worked reasonably well, albeit with a stronger plastic smell than I expected. However, after just four months of very light use (maybe twice a week), the unit has completely failed, and my experience with customer support has been equally abysmal. The initial performance was acceptable. It made decent fries and crispy chicken, though the internal temperature always seemed to run a bit hotter than selected, requiring me to adjust timings downwards. The digital interface was a bit clunky, sometimes requiring firm presses, but it generally got the job done. I was willing to overlook these minor issues for the convenience. Then, last week, in the middle of air frying some vegetables, the unit suddenly powered off. The screen went black, and it became completely unresponsive. I tried unplugging it, waiting, plugging it into different outlets \u2013 nothing. It's completely dead. No power, no display, no fan, nothing. For an appliance to fail so spectacularly and so quickly after purchase is simply unacceptable. This isn't a minor flaw; it's a complete lack of reliability and suggests very poor internal components or manufacturing quality. What made this experience even worse was trying to get help from Cosori customer support. Their online system is convoluted, and when I finally managed to get through to someone, they put me through a lengthy troubleshooting script that I had already performed, as if I hadn't already stated the unit was completely dead. They then informed me I would need to ship the entire unit back to them for inspection, at my own cost, for a product that failed after four months of light use. This is outrageous. A functional product should not fail this quickly, and a company should stand behind its products with a better warranty and support process. I am now left with a non-functional, expensive piece of plastic taking up counter space. This is not just a bad product; it's a complete waste of money and time. I would strongly advise anyone considering the COSORI Pro II to look elsewhere. The lack of reliability and poor customer service make this a product I cannot recommend in good conscience. Save yourself the headache and invest in a more reputable brand with a proven track record for durability and customer care.",

      "title": "A Culinary Dream Come True \u2013 Exceeded All Expectations for Health and Taste!",
      "review_text": "As a long-time advocate for healthy eating and someone who loves to cook but loathes excessive cleanup, the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, has been nothing short of a revelation in my kitchen. I researched air fryers for months, looking for the perfect balance of capacity, features, and ease of use, and this model has absolutely exceeded all my expectations. From the moment it arrived, I was impressed by the quality of the packaging and the sleek, modern aesthetic of the appliance itself. It looks fantastic on my kitchen counter. The initial setup was straightforward, and the user manual was clear and concise. But the real magic began with the first meal. My go-to test for any new cooking appliance is chicken breast, and the COSORI Pro II delivered the most tender, juicy chicken I've ever made at home, with a beautifully golden, slightly crispy exterior \u2013 all with just a tiny spritz of oil. The versatility of this 5.8QT model is incredible. I've roasted perfect broccoli and cauliflower, made restaurant-quality crispy potato wedges, reheated leftover pizza to its original glory (no more soggy slices!), and even baked small batches of cookies that came out perfectly. The presets are incredibly helpful, providing a solid starting point, but the ability to fine-tune temperature and time gives you complete control. I particularly love how quickly it preheats compared to my conventional oven, saving significant time during busy weeknights. The healthy aspect is a huge win. We're consuming significantly less oil, yet still enjoying the satisfying textures of traditionally fried foods. It feels like a guilt-free indulgence. Cleaning is also incredibly easy; the non-stick basket and crisper plate are a dream to wash by hand, or they can go into the dishwasher. No more scrubbing greasy pans! The capacity is ideal for my family of three, and often enough for a small gathering of four. If I were forced to find a minor flaw, it would be that the fan noise is present, though not excessively loud, it's certainly audible. Also, while the manual covers the basics, a more extensive recipe book included in the box would be a delightful addition for those looking for inspiration beyond the obvious. These are minor considerations given the overall outstanding performance and convenience. In summary, the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo is an exceptional appliance that has truly enhanced my cooking experience. It's fast, efficient, healthy, and consistently produces delicious results. It's an investment that pays dividends in both time saved and healthier meals enjoyed. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their home cooking game!",

      "title": "Reliable, Efficient, and Mostly Easy \u2013 A Great Addition to Our Kitchen",
      "review_text": "After years of debating whether an air fryer was truly necessary, my husband and I finally decided to jump on the bandwagon and purchased the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT. Our goal was to reduce our reliance on takeout and enjoy healthier versions of our favorite \"fried\" foods. After several months of consistent use, we can confidently say it was a worthwhile investment that has become a staple in our kitchen. The first thing that impressed us was the speed. It heats up incredibly fast compared to our conventional oven, meaning we can get dinner on the table much quicker on busy weeknights. We've used it for a wide variety of foods: chicken tenders, frozen fries, roasted vegetables (broccoli and bell peppers are fantastic), and reheating leftovers like spring rolls and pizza. The hot air circulation does an excellent job, consistently delivering crispy exteriors and tender interiors without drowning food in oil. We've certainly noticed a difference in our oil consumption. The 5.8QT capacity is perfect for the two of us, allowing ample space for even cooking without overcrowding. The digital controls are intuitive, and the pre-set functions are a great starting point for various dishes. We quickly learned to adjust timings based on our preferences, but the basic functionality is user-friendly. Cleaning is also a major plus; the non-stick basket and crisper plate usually wipe clean with ease, though occasionally some sticky sauces require a bit more attention. However, there are a couple of small issues that keep it from a perfect 5-star rating. Firstly, while the non-stick coating is effective, we've noticed that the tiny rubber bumpers on the crisper plate, which protect the basket from scratches, can occasionally pop off when we're washing it. They're easy enough to put back, but it's a minor annoyance. Secondly, the overall exterior design, while functional, is a bit utilitarian. We would have appreciated a more premium finish or color options to better match our kitchen aesthetic. Lastly, the included recipe book is very basic; we've had to rely heavily on online resources for more creative air fryer recipes. Despite these minor quibbles, the COSORI Pro II is a robust and efficient appliance. It\u2019s significantly contributed to our healthier eating habits and made cooking more enjoyable. It's a fantastic choice for couples or small families looking for a reliable air fryer that performs consistently well. We're very happy with our purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a dependable countertop cooker.",

      "title": "Functional But Uninspired \u2013 Not Quite the Upgrade I Was Hoping For",
      "review_text": "I bought the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, hoping for a significant upgrade from my older, smaller air fryer that was showing its age. I was looking for more capacity, better heating consistency, and perhaps some enhanced features given the \"Pro II\" designation. After several months of regular use, I can say it's functional, but it hasn't quite delivered on being a truly inspiring or significantly improved appliance, settling squarely in the \"average\" category. The 5.8QT capacity is definitely a step up and the main reason I keep it. It allows me to cook enough chicken wings or a decent portion of fries for a small gathering without needing multiple batches, which is a convenience. When it cooks well, the food comes out perfectly crispy and golden, particularly frozen items like onion rings or spring rolls. The digital interface is straightforward enough, and the preset buttons are a decent starting point, though I almost always adjust them. Cleanup is generally easy with the non-stick coating, which is a definite plus. However, several aspects prevent me from being enthusiastic about it. Firstly, the \"Pro II\" branding feels a bit misleading. There are no smart features, no app connectivity, and nothing that truly differentiates it as a \"Pro\" model compared to Cosori's basic versions, or even competitors' \"smart\" air fryers. It feels like a standard digital air fryer with increased capacity, and that's it. For the price, I expected more innovation. Secondly, the heating consistency isn't always perfect. I've noticed hot spots, especially with larger batches of food, even when diligently shaking and rotating the basket. This means some items can be overcooked while others remain slightly underdone. It requires more attention than I would like from a modern appliance. It's not terrible, but it's not the perfectly even cooking I was hoping for. The fan noise is also quite noticeable, and sometimes feels louder than it should be. Lastly, the overall build quality, while sturdy enough, doesn't feel premium. The plastic housing looks decent from afar but up close, it just feels like standard appliance plastic. I've also had a minor issue with the basket sliding in and out smoothly; sometimes it catches slightly, requiring a bit of a jiggle. In conclusion, the COSORI Pro II is a decent air fryer that does what it's supposed to, but it doesn't stand out from the crowd. It functions well enough as a larger-capacity air fryer for basic tasks, but it lacks the 'wow' factor, consistent cooking perfection, or advanced features that would justify its \"Pro II\" name and price point. It's a satisfactory purchase, but I'm left wishing for a bit more.",

      "title": "Overpriced and Underperforming \u2013 Mostly Shelf-Ware Now",
      "review_text": "I splurged on the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, about seven months ago, convinced by the hype that it would revolutionize my cooking. Unfortunately, it has mostly become an expensive piece of shelf-ware in my kitchen. The promises of crispy, healthy food quickly and easily have largely gone unfulfilled due to a combination of design flaws, inconsistent performance, and a general lack of usability. My biggest gripe is the cooking performance itself. Despite its \"Pro II\" name, I find the heating incredibly uneven. Food often comes out either burnt in some spots and raw in others, or just generally dry and unappetizing. I've tried everything \u2013 preheating, using minimal oil, shaking the basket constantly, even rotating the food mid-cycle \u2013 but the results are consistently disappointing. Chicken breasts dry out to tough leather, and fries are a mix of limp and overly crunchy. It feels like the hot air doesn't circulate effectively, or the heating element is poorly designed. It's simply not reliable for consistent, good-tasting meals. The interface, while digital, is clunky. The touch buttons often require multiple, firm presses to register, which is frustrating when you're trying to quickly set a cooking time. It feels cheap and unresponsive. The noise level is also a significant issue for me. It's incredibly loud, like a small vacuum cleaner running on my counter, making it unpleasant to use, especially in an open-plan kitchen. Furthermore, the cleaning, which many rave about, has become a hassle. While the non-stick coating worked initially, I've noticed food starting to stick more and more, even with light oil. Scrubbing off residue has become more frequent, negating some of the ease of use. The overall build quality also feels flimsy for the price. I expected a more robust construction that would withstand regular use, but it feels largely plastic and prone to wear. In summary, this COSORI air fryer has been a significant disappointment. It's overpriced for the inconsistent, often poor results it delivers, and the user experience is hampered by a clunky interface and excessive noise. It rarely leaves the shelf now, as I find myself reverting to my traditional oven or even just pan-frying because the results are simply better and less frustrating. I would not recommend this product. Save your money and look for an air fryer with a proven track record for consistent performance and user-friendly design.",

      "title": "A Week of Use, Then Sparked and Died \u2013 Unsafe and Unreliable!",
      "review_text": "I am absolutely furious and frankly, scared, after my experience with the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT. I purchased this appliance just *one week* ago, specifically for quick, healthy meals as I'm recovering from surgery and have limited energy for cooking. After only a handful of uses, it completely malfunctioned in a terrifying way, rendering it useless and posing a serious safety risk. For the first few days, it seemed to work okay, though I did notice a very strong plastic burning smell during operation, which I initially put down to \"new appliance\" odors. I cooked some chicken tenders and fries, and they came out decent, not amazing, but acceptable. The digital display was a bit stiff, requiring firm presses, but I overlooked it. Then, on the sixth day of ownership, I was cooking some frozen fish fillets. About 10 minutes into the cycle, I heard a loud *pop* inside the unit, followed immediately by a visible spark from the back vent area and a puff of smoke. The unit immediately powered down and now it is completely dead. There is no power, no display, nothing. It looks like an electrical component simply failed and potentially shorted out, causing the spark and smoke. This happened right on my kitchen counter, and I am incredibly grateful I was in the room and able to unplug it immediately. This is not just a defective product; it's a dangerous one. A brand new appliance should *never* spark and smoke after a week of light use. I am appalled by the lack of quality control and the potential fire hazard this product represents. I bought this air fryer for convenience and peace of mind, not for fear and a ruined appliance. My attempts to contact Cosori customer service have been frustrating; I'm stuck in an automated loop and haven't been able to speak to a live person to report this serious safety issue. This COSORI Pro II Air Fryer is a complete failure and an unsafe product. I would urge anyone considering this model to think twice. It's clearly unreliable and potentially hazardous. Do not risk your safety or your home. This is going straight into the trash, and I will be looking for a completely different brand for my next air fryer.",

      "review_text": "As a fitness enthusiast and busy working parent, my kitchen appliances need to pull double duty: make healthy meals easy, and deliver delicious results quickly. The COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, has not only met these demands but exceeded them, quickly becoming the Most Valuable Player in my kitchen. This isn't just an air fryer; it's a healthy cooking powerhouse. From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and solid build quality impressed me. It doesn't take up an excessive amount of counter space for its generous 5.8QT capacity, which is perfect for feeding my family of four. The digital interface is incredibly intuitive, with clearly labeled presets that make cooking a breeze, even for someone who's not super confident in the kitchen. My kids can even use it for their afternoon snacks safely and easily. The performance is truly outstanding. We've used it for everything imaginable. Chicken breasts come out perfectly moist and tender with a lovely crispy exterior. Roasted vegetables (think broccoli florets, asparagus spears, or bell peppers) are transformed into caramelized, slightly charred perfection in a fraction of the time it would take in a conventional oven. Homemade sweet potato fries are a weekly staple now \u2013 crispy, flavorful, and with minimal oil. Reheating leftovers is another area where it excels; pizza gets its crisp crust back, and day-old spring rolls taste freshly made. The speed and efficiency are game-changers, especially on chaotic weeknights. The non-stick basket and crisper plate make cleanup incredibly easy. A quick wash with soap and water is usually all it takes, and it's ready for the next meal. This is a huge bonus for someone who hates scrubbing dishes. The healthier aspect cannot be overstated \u2013 we're eating far less oil but not sacrificing flavor or texture. It's helped us stick to our nutritional goals without feeling deprived. If I had to find a very minor point for improvement, it's that the fan noise is present, similar to a powerful extractor fan, but it's not overly disruptive. Also, while the included instructions are good, a dedicated COSORI recipe app or a more extensive recipe book tailored to this model would be a fantastic addition to inspire even more culinary adventures. These are truly minor points against an otherwise stellar product. In conclusion, the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo is an exceptional kitchen appliance that delivers on all its promises. It's fast, efficient, incredibly versatile, and consistently produces delicious, healthy food. It has genuinely simplified my cooking routine and helped my family maintain a healthier lifestyle without compromise. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their home cooking and make healthy eating effortless.",

      "title": "A Solid Workhorse for Family Meals, With Room for Small Improvements",
      "review_text": "As a mom of three, anything that makes mealtime easier and healthier is a welcome addition to my kitchen. We purchased the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, primarily to get crispy food without the deep-fryer mess and guilt, and to speed up dinner prep. After about a year of pretty intense family use, it's safe to say it's earned its permanent spot on the counter, proving to be a reliable workhorse, albeit with a few minor quirks. The 5.8QT capacity is decent for our family. I can cook a good batch of chicken wings or two substantial chicken breasts, and sides like fries usually require two batches for optimal crispiness, but that's typical for air fryers and still faster than the oven. The cooking performance is generally excellent; food comes out wonderfully crispy on the outside and moist inside. Chicken tenders, fish sticks, and roasted veggies are always a hit. The hot air circulation works well, and the results are consistently superior to oven-baked equivalents. The quick preheat time is a huge bonus on school nights. The digital controls are intuitive, and the presets are helpful for quick starts, though I've found myself customizing times and temperatures more as I've gotten more comfortable. Cleaning is also quite easy; the non-stick basket and crisper plate usually just need a quick hand wash, or they go into the dishwasher without issue. It's a significant improvement over dealing with greasy deep-fryer oil. My main reasons for not giving it a full five stars relate to a couple of design details. Firstly, after a year, I've noticed some minor wear on the non-stick coating around the very edges of the crisper plate, despite being meticulous with care and only using soft utensils. It's not flaking off into food yet, but it makes me question its long-term durability. Secondly, the overall build, while sturdy, is mostly plastic. For a \"Pro II\" model, a more premium material like brushed stainless steel for parts of the exterior would have elevated its look and feel, and potentially its perceived durability. Lastly, the rubber stoppers on the crisper plate have become a bit loose over time and occasionally fall off during washing, which is a minor but recurring annoyance. In essence, the COSORI Pro II is a fantastic, dependable appliance that has genuinely helped us eat healthier and save time in the kitchen. It delivers excellent cooking results most of the time. The minor issues with coating durability and design aesthetics are just small points in an otherwise very positive experience. For families looking for a powerful and convenient air fryer, this is a strong contender, and I would definitely recommend it.",

      "title": "Mixed Feelings \u2013 Capacity is Good, But Consistency and Quality Are Lacking",
      "review_text": "As someone who loves kitchen gadgets and is always looking for ways to streamline cooking, I was eager to get my hands on the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT. I needed something with enough capacity for my meal prep for the week and for entertaining small groups. While the size is certainly a plus, my overall experience has been a mixed bag, leaving me with significant reservations about its long-term value and quality. The 5.8QT capacity is indeed generous and is one of the best features of this unit. I can fit a decent amount of food, whether it's a batch of chicken thighs for dinner or several portions of roasted vegetables for meal prep. When it hits the sweet spot, the food comes out deliciously crispy and evenly cooked, especially things like chicken wings or breaded fish. The preheat time is quick, and the digital display is easy to read. However, the consistency of its cooking performance is where I start to run into issues. Despite my best efforts with preheating, shaking the basket, and ensuring no overcrowding, I frequently encounter uneven cooking. Some parts of the food are perfectly done, while others are either undercooked or overly browned. This means I'm constantly having to open the basket, check, and manually adjust, which defeats the purpose of the timer and convenience. It feels like the airflow isn't as uniform as it should be, or there are hot spots I can't control. This makes relying on it for important meals a bit of a gamble. Beyond performance, the build quality and noise level are also concerns. The unit is quite loud when operating, emitting a high-pitched hum that can be intrusive in a quiet kitchen. More troublingly, after just five months of moderate use, I've noticed significant wear on the non-stick coating of the crisper plate. There are small chips and areas where the coating seems to be thinning, despite only using non-abrasive cleaning methods and silicone utensils. This early deterioration is unacceptable for an appliance in this price range and raises concerns about food safety and durability. In conclusion, the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo offers good capacity but struggles with consistent cooking and shows premature signs of wear. While it has its moments of delivering good results, the frustration of uneven cooking and the concern about the non-stick coating's longevity make it hard for me to wholeheartedly recommend. It's a functional appliance, but for the price and the \"Pro II\" branding, I expected a higher level of consistent performance and durability. I'm already looking at alternative brands for a potential replacement.",

      "title": "Lacking Essential Features and Questionable Airflow, Not for Experienced Cooks",
      "review_text": "As a culinary school graduate and a home cook who appreciates precision and consistent results, I approached the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, with a healthy dose of skepticism but an open mind. I hoped it would be a useful tool for quick, small-batch cooking and crisping. Unfortunately, after several months of trying to make it work, I'm left quite underwhelmed. It lacks fundamental features I'd expect, and the airflow seems poorly designed. My main issue is the complete lack of granular control and inconsistent cooking. The presets are too simplistic, and while you can manually adjust time and temperature, the results are rarely what I'd consider precise or even. I frequently find that food cooks much faster on the side facing the heating element or fan, leading to a burnt exterior while the opposite side is still pale or undercooked. This is particularly noticeable with items like thicker cuts of meat or anything that requires a uniform crisp. Even with constant shaking and flipping, achieving even browning is a challenge, which suggests a fundamental flaw in the air circulation design. For an appliance named \"Pro II,\" I expected advanced temperature control and more uniform heating, not hot and cold spots. Another significant drawback is the absence of a \"shake\" reminder or pause function that automatically stops the timer when the basket is pulled out. This is a common feature on many basic air fryers, and its omission here feels like a significant oversight for a \"Pro\" model. It means I have to manually pause the timer, or remember where I was, which disrupts the cooking flow. The unit is also quite loud, and the digital display, while bright, isn't as responsive as I'd like, often requiring firm presses. Furthermore, the materials feel a bit cheap. The plastic exterior is prone to smudges, and I've already seen minor chipping on the non-stick basket despite extremely careful use. For a product aimed at a potentially more discerning user (implied by \"Pro II\"), the build quality feels more entry-level. While it can produce *okay* fries or chicken nuggets for a quick snack, it simply doesn't meet the standards for quality, consistent cooking that I require. It's a basic air fryer with a decent capacity, but it's overpriced for its performance and feature set. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who values precision, even cooking, or expects \"Pro\" level features. It's mostly relegated to a backup appliance for extremely simple tasks now.",

      "review_text": "My experience with the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, has been nothing short of a nightmare, capped off by abysmal customer service. I bought this unit just under five months ago, hoping it would be a reliable way to make healthier meals for my family. What I got instead was a quickly failing appliance and endless frustration. Initially, the air fryer seemed to work okay. The 5.8QT capacity was good for our family of four, and we managed to get some decent fries and chicken. However, the cooking was never perfectly even, always requiring extra shaking and flipping, and the digital controls were a bit unresponsive from the start. I also noticed a persistent, strong plastic smell during operation that never quite went away, which was a bit concerning but I tried to overlook it. Then, about four and a half months in, the unit started exhibiting major issues. First, the fan began making a grinding noise, intermittently at first, then constantly. Soon after, the heating element became unreliable. It would sometimes heat up, sometimes not, or it would heat inconsistently. This led to food that was either completely undercooked or burnt on one side and raw on the other. Eventually, the unit stopped heating altogether, and now it just blows cold air, effectively making it a very loud, non-functional fan. A product failing so significantly in less than five months of moderate use is unacceptable. What truly compounds the problem is Cosori's customer service. After hours spent on hold, multiple emails, and being shuffled between different departments, I was finally told that while it's under warranty, the process for replacement or repair is incredibly convoluted. They want me to package and ship back a large, heavy, non-functional appliance at my own expense, then wait for an \"evaluation\" which could take weeks, before they *might* send a replacement. This is an enormous burden for a product that failed prematurely. Their responses were generic and unhelpful, showing no empathy for the inconvenience. I am utterly disgusted with both the product's poor quality and the company's terrible support. This was an expensive appliance that failed quickly, and the manufacturer makes it extremely difficult to get a resolution. I strongly advise against purchasing the COSORI Pro II.

      "review_text": "I was on the fence about getting an air fryer, thinking it might just be another kitchen gadget that gathers dust. But after countless recommendations from friends, I finally took the plunge with the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase. It has not only met but truly exceeded all my expectations, becoming an indispensable part of my daily cooking routine. The 5.8QT capacity is perfect for my small family of three, and even when I have guests over, it handles appetizers and side dishes with ease. Setting it up was a breeze, and the intuitive digital interface meant I was cooking delicious food within minutes. The pre-programmed settings are a fantastic starting point for air fryer newbies, guiding you through common items like fries, chicken, and shrimp with optimal settings. But the manual controls offer enough flexibility for more adventurous cooks like myself. Where this COSORI truly shines is in its performance. The hot air circulation is incredibly efficient, producing food that is wonderfully crispy on the outside and perfectly tender and juicy on the inside, all with a fraction of the oil you'd use in traditional frying. My homemade chicken wings are now legendary \u2013 perfectly golden and crunchy every time. Roasted vegetables (asparagus, broccoli, sweet potatoes) come out with a beautiful char and tenderness that my conventional oven struggles to achieve. Even reheating leftovers like pizza or spring rolls results in a fresh-tasting, crispy texture that a microwave simply can't replicate. It's fast, efficient, and makes healthy eating so much more enjoyable. Cleanup is another huge win. The non-stick basket and crisper plate are incredibly easy to clean; most of the time, a quick wipe with a sponge and warm, soapy water does the trick. They're also dishwasher safe, which is a major convenience. This ease of cleaning means I use it much more often than I anticipated. The overall build feels solid and durable, and it has a sleek look that fits well on my countertop. If I were to nitpick, the only minor point I can think of is the audible fan noise during operation, but it's comparable to a microwave or a quiet range hood and certainly not disruptive. Also, a dedicated Cosori recipe app for this specific model would be a great bonus for more recipe ideas. However, these are incredibly minor considerations when weighed against the consistent performance and sheer convenience this air fryer provides. The COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo is an absolute game-changer. It has simplified my cooking, made healthy meals more accessible and appealing, and consistently delivered delicious, crispy results. If you're looking for an air fryer that truly performs and will quickly become your most used kitchen appliance, this is the one to get. I wholeheartedly recommend it!",

      "review_text": "As a professional chef who also cooks at home for my family, I approach kitchen gadgets with a critical eye. I picked up the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, not expecting miracles, but rather a reliable tool for quick, healthy meals and reheating. After several months of daily use, it has largely surpassed my expectations, becoming a trusted helper in our busy kitchen. The 5.8QT capacity is surprisingly versatile. It's perfect for quickly crisping up portions of vegetables, making crispy chicken tenders for the kids, or even air-frying small cuts of steak or fish for a weeknight dinner for our family of four. The speed at which it preheats and cooks is a significant time-saver compared to a traditional oven, which is invaluable on busy evenings. The hot air circulation is powerful and generally very effective, creating that desirable crispy texture without excessive oil, which is a big win for healthier eating. We've found the results for frozen items like fries and spring rolls to be far superior to oven baking. The digital controls are straightforward and intuitive. While I prefer manual temperature and time settings, the presets are a good starting point for less experienced cooks. I particularly appreciate how easy it is to clean; the non-stick basket and crisper plate slide out smoothly and usually require just a quick wash. This efficiency in cleanup encourages more frequent use. The build quality feels solid enough for its price point, and it doesn't take up an obnoxious amount of counter space. My main critiques are minor but worth mentioning. Firstly, while the airflow is good, it's not perfectly uniform. For larger or thicker items, I still find myself having to shake the basket or flip the food multiple times to ensure even cooking and browning. It's not a set-it-and-forget-it appliance if you want truly consistent chef-level results, but for most home cooking, it's very good. Secondly, the fan noise, while not excessively loud, is definitely present and consistent, which can be a minor distraction in a quiet kitchen. Lastly, the rubber stoppers on the crisper plate, designed to protect the basket, can sometimes come loose during cleaning, which is a small nuisance. Overall, the COSORI Pro II is a very strong performer in the air fryer category. It's efficient, reliable, and produces consistently good results for everyday cooking. While it doesn't quite achieve perfect, uniform cooking every single time without intervention, it gets very close and offers immense convenience and health benefits. For anyone looking for a dependable air fryer for a small to medium-sized family, this model is an excellent choice and one I would recommend.",

      "title": "A Useful Appliance, But Not Without Its Frustrations \u2013 Could Be Better",
      "review_text": "I\u2019m a gadget guy, and the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, caught my eye with its promise of healthy, crispy food. After several months of putting it through its paces for various dishes, I\u2019ve concluded it\u2019s a useful appliance that definitely has its place in the kitchen, but it\u2019s not without its frustrations and doesn\u2019t quite live up to the \"Pro II\" moniker or its potential. The capacity is a strong point. The 5.8QT size is great for my partner and me, and I can fit a decent amount of food in there for quick meals or appetizers. When it works well, it produces some genuinely good results: perfectly crispy chicken tenders, surprisingly well-roasted vegetables, and reheated pizza that actually tastes fresh. It heats up quickly, much faster than a conventional oven, and the non-stick basket makes cleanup generally easy, which is a big plus. The digital interface is mostly straightforward, and the presets are a good starting point for basic items. However, the experience is marred by inconsistencies. I've found that the air circulation isn't always as even as it should be. Despite diligent shaking and flipping, I often end up with food that's overcooked in some areas and undercooked in others. This is particularly noticeable with larger batches or irregularly shaped items. It requires more constant monitoring and manual intervention than I'd like from a modern appliance, reducing the \"set it and forget it\" convenience. This inconsistency can be really frustrating when you're aiming for a perfect result. Another point of contention is the build quality and noise level. The unit is quite loud during operation, emitting a high-pitched whirring sound that can be distracting. The exterior is predominantly plastic, which feels a bit less premium than I expected for a \"Pro II\" model. I've also noticed that the basket occasionally sticks a bit when sliding it in and out, requiring a slight jiggle, which feels like a minor manufacturing tolerance issue. While I appreciate its speed and the fact that it uses less oil, the COSORI Pro II just doesn't consistently deliver the kind of precise, even cooking I expect. It\u2019s a good supplementary cooking tool for specific tasks, but it hasn\u2019t replaced my oven for reliability or consistency. It's a functional air fryer that gets the job done, but it falls short of being a truly excellent or \"pro-level\" appliance. It's a 3-star product for me \u2013 useful, but with clear room for improvement in consistency and overall user experience.",

      "title": "Overrated and Overpriced \u2013 My Old Air Fryer Was Better",
      "review_text": "I bought the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, about six months ago as a supposed upgrade from an older, smaller air fryer that was simply getting a bit too old. I figured \"Pro II\" and the larger capacity meant better performance and features. I was wrong. This unit has been a constant source of frustration, and I honestly preferred my cheaper, older model. It's overrated and overpriced for what it delivers. My biggest issue is the inconsistent cooking. Despite its powerful fan, the hot air circulation seems remarkably uneven. I've tried to cook everything from chicken wings to simple frozen fries, and the results are almost always a mixed bag: some pieces are burnt to a crisp, while others are barely cooked through, even with vigilant shaking and flipping. It's like it has extreme hot and cold spots that I can't control. This makes cooking a guessing game and completely undermines the convenience factor of an air fryer. My previous, basic air fryer, despite its smaller size, cooked far more evenly. The \"Pro II\" branding feels like a total misnomer. There are no advanced features, no smart connectivity, just a basic digital interface that's often unresponsive. The touch buttons require firm presses, and sometimes don't register at all, leading to repeated attempts to set the time or temperature. This adds to the frustration. The noise level is also significantly higher than my old unit, making it quite intrusive in my small apartment kitchen. Adding insult to injury, the non-stick coating on the crisper plate is already showing signs of wear and tear, with small chips and areas of thinning, despite following all care instructions. This is unacceptable for an appliance that's only six months old and used moderately. It speaks to a lack of durability and quality control. I honestly regret this purchase. I spent more money for what I thought would be an improvement, and instead, I got a louder, less reliable, and less user-friendly appliance that's already breaking down. It's mostly relegated to a corner now, only used for very basic tasks where inconsistent cooking isn't a huge deal. I would strongly advise against this model. Save your money, or buy a simpler, more reliable brand. This COSORI Pro II is a disappointment.",

      "title": "A Complete Fire Hazard \u2013 Unit Smoked and Died After First Use!",
      "review_text": "This review is not just a complaint about a faulty product; it's a serious warning about a potential fire hazard. I received the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, 5.8QT, yesterday. I was incredibly excited to use it for the first time, thinking it would be a great addition to my kitchen for healthier meals. My excitement quickly turned into shock and anger. I followed the instructions meticulously, including the initial \"test run\" to burn off any manufacturing oils. During this empty preheating cycle, about 5 minutes in, I noticed a very strong, acrid plastic burning smell emanating from the unit. I quickly opened the basket to check, and there was no food inside, but the smell intensified. As I closed the basket, I then heard a distinct *pop* sound from inside the unit, followed by a visible puff of grey smoke rising from the back vents. The unit immediately powered off and became completely unresponsive. No lights, no fan, nothing. It was dead after a single, empty test run. I am absolutely horrified. A brand new appliance, fresh out of the box, should not spark, smoke, and die on its very first use. This is a massive failure in quality control and poses a severe safety risk. Had I put food in it and left the room for a moment, this could have escalated into a serious kitchen fire. It's alarming to think about the potential danger this product represents. I immediately unplugged it and will not be using it again, or any other Cosori product given this experience. My attempts to contact Cosori customer service have been frustrating and unhelpful. I was directed to an online form and a lengthy FAQ, with no immediate way to report a critical safety incident. This entire experience has been incredibly disappointing and terrifying. Do NOT buy this air fryer. It is a dangerous, unreliable, and poorly manufactured product. It's a fire hazard waiting to happen. Save your money and, more importantly, ensure your safety by choosing a different brand. This COSORI Pro II is a ticking time bomb.",
