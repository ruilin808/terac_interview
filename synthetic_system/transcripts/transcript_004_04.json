      "text": "Good morning, West. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is David, and I'm a representative from COSORI. We really appreciate you sharing your feedback, especially through your online review, and we're hoping to learn a bit more about your experience with our Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo. This conversation is purely for internal research to help us improve our products."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 2,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Good morning, David. Yeah, happy to chat. I mean, my review pretty much lays it all out, but I'm open to discussing it further if it helps."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 3,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "It certainly does, West. Your detailed feedback is invaluable to us. To start, could you tell me a little more about what initially drew you to the COSORI Pro II? What were you hoping to achieve with it when you first made the purchase eight months ago?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Hmm, well, like I mentioned in the review, it was mainly the promise of quick, healthy meals. I was looking for something to streamline my cooking, especially since I'm often home during the day now, and I wanted to eat better without a huge fuss. The capacity was also a big draw. I like to cook for myself, but also sometimes have friends over, or just make a larger batch of something. I'd heard a lot about air fryers, and the COSORI brand seemed well-regarded, so it felt like a good bet."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That makes perfect sense. And before you got the COSORI, what methods were you typically using for those quick or healthier meals? Were you using a conventional oven, or perhaps a different type of countertop appliance?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Mostly my conventional oven, honestly. Or sometimes just the stovetop, for things like stir-fries. I had a smaller, older toaster oven too, but it was really just for, well, toast. The idea of getting that crispy texture with less oil without preheating a huge oven for small batches was really appealing. I looked at a few different brands, I think, Ninja, maybe Phillips, but the COSORI just seemed to hit the sweet spot on features and price at the time."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I see. So the efficiency and health benefits were key drivers. You mentioned in your review that it did deliver on the \"quick\" part initially. Could you elaborate a bit on what that looked like? What foods were you making, and how did that initial experience feel in terms of speed?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Oh, definitely quick. Things like frozen fries, chicken tenders, roasted vegetables... I mean, it would cut the cooking time pretty significantly compared to my regular oven. A big sheet pan of roasted broccoli might take 25-30 minutes, but in the air fryer, it felt like 15, maybe 20, and it got that really nice char and crispness. Same with chicken \u2013 it cooked through quickly, and the skin would get really golden. That part was great, honestly."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That's good to hear that aspect met your expectations initially. Now, let's talk about some of the challenges you've encountered. The first thing you highlighted in your review was the noise. You described it as \"ridiculously loud,\" like a \"jet engine.\" Can you tell me more about how that noise impacts your day-to-day use?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "*Sighs* Oh, David, it's just... disruptive. Honestly, it's the first thing I notice every time I turn it on. My kitchen is part of an open-plan living space here in Los Angeles, so when that thing fires up, it's not just in the kitchen, it's *everywhere*. If I'm trying to have a phone call, or listen to music, or even just watch TV in the next room, it's impossible to ignore. I definitely can't use it late at night or early in the morning, which defeats some of the convenience, you know? My partner is a light sleeper, and even a floor above, they\u2019d hear it. It's just too much. I mean, my dishwasher, which is ancient, is quieter than this thing."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially with an open-plan living space. It makes perfect sense that it would limit your usage times. Has the noise level changed at all since you first bought it, or has it always been this pronounced?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "It feels like it\u2019s gotten worse, actually. Or maybe I\u2019ve just become more sensitive to it because I\u2019m using it more now that I\u2019m not working. Initially, I thought, \"Okay, it's a powerful fan, it's going to make some noise.\" But over time, it just became truly obnoxious. There's almost a slight rattling sound sometimes, too, which makes me wonder if something is loose inside."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That's concerning, West. We'll certainly note the potential increase in noise and the rattling. Moving on to the cooking performance, you mentioned it's become inconsistent. Foods are either overcooked and dry, or surprisingly soggy, and you highlighted issues with uneven heat distribution. Could you give me a specific example of when this inconsistency was particularly frustrating?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Oh, so many examples. But the chicken nuggets one really sticks out. I was making them for a quick lunch \u2013 they\u2019re usually a no-brainer, right? I followed the recommended time and temperature, flipped them halfway, everything. But when I pulled them out, the ones on top looked perfectly golden, almost too much so, while the ones underneath, even after flipping, were still pale and surprisingly cold in the middle. It\u2019s like the hot air just isn\u2019t circulating properly anymore. I ended up having to essentially re-cook them, spreading them out, individually checking each one. It adds 10, 15 minutes to what should be a five-minute job, and then they're often dried out. It takes away the \"quick\" entirely."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I can certainly understand how that would be frustrating and negate the convenience you sought. When you say you're meticulously monitoring and adjusting, what kind of adjustments are you typically making now that you weren't making initially? Are you changing temperatures, times, or is it more about physically rearranging the food?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Mostly physically rearranging. Like, I\u2019ll pull the basket out, shake it, flip individual pieces. Sometimes I\u2019ll drop the temperature down a bit, or add more time, but it\u2019s mostly trying to combat those hot and cold spots. It's not a set-it-and-forget-it appliance anymore; it's a babysit-it-and-pray-it-works appliance."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "\"Babysit-it-and-pray-it-works\" \u2013 that's a powerful image, West. Thank you for that specific feedback. You also mentioned the digital controls have become temperamental, requiring multiple presses. When did you start noticing that, and how does that impact your overall user experience?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "That\u2019s probably been happening for the last two, maybe three months? It's not every time, but often enough to be annoying. I\u2019ll press the temperature button, and nothing happens. Press it again, maybe a third time, then it registers. Same with the time, or the start/pause button. It just feels... sluggish, unresponsive. It makes me wonder about the quality of the internal components, you know? Like, are they just wearing out already? It\u2019s not what I expect from a relatively new appliance, especially for the price I paid."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That's definitely not the experience we want our customers to have, and it sounds like it compounds the other frustrations. And speaking of wear, your biggest concern was the durability, specifically the non-stick coating flaking off the crisper plate after only eight months. Could you describe the extent of this flaking and what your cleaning routine has been like for the crisper plate?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Oh, it\u2019s quite visible now. There are several spots, mostly around the edges and where the food rests most often, where the black coating has just chipped away, revealing the metal underneath. It's not huge chunks, but definitely noticeable patches. As for cleaning, I am *very* careful. I only ever use a soft sponge \u2013 never anything abrasive \u2013 and just mild dish soap. And absolutely no metal utensils have ever touched that surface. I\u2019m quite meticulous with my kitchenware, especially non-stick. I know how important it is to preserve it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so alarming to see this happening so quickly. It really makes me question the manufacturing quality."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I hear you, West. It's completely understandable to be concerned, especially given your diligent care. When you see that flaking, what goes through your mind regarding continuing to use the product? Are there any safety implications you're considering?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Absolutely. That's my biggest worry, honestly. If tiny bits of that coating are flaking off, where are they going? Into my food, presumably. And I just don't know what that coating is made of. Is it safe to ingest? I'm quite health-conscious, and the idea of potentially consuming micro-plastics or whatever other chemicals are in that non-stick material... it's just not something I'm willing to risk. It\u2019s really made me hesitant to use it at all now. It almost feels like a health hazard at this point."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That's a very valid and serious concern, West, and it's something we take very seriously. Thank you for articulating that. It sounds like the promise of convenience and health has been completely overshadowed by these issues, especially the durability. Looking back, was there anything about the COSORI Pro II that exceeded your expectations, even for a short period, aside from the initial quick cooking time?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Hmm... well, I suppose the actual capacity *is* good. It\u2019s a decent size, and when it *did* cook well, it could handle a good amount of food. And I liked the aesthetic of it on my counter. It looks sleek. But honestly, those positives are completely eclipsed by the noise, the inconsistent cooking, and now this flaking. It's hard to find much to rave about when the core functionality and safety are compromised."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "I understand completely. It's clear the negative experiences have really impacted your perception. You mentioned you're looking into replacing it. What are you looking for in a new air fryer, or a different cooking solution, that you feel the COSORI Pro II is not providing or has actively disappointed you on? What would be your top priorities?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "My top priorities, definitely, would be quiet operation, consistent cooking results, and proven durability. I\u2019m willing to pay a premium for those things. I need something that will last longer than eight months and won't make me question the safety of my food. I'd also look for more intuitive and reliable controls \u2013 maybe physical dials or buttons that give better tactile feedback, rather than touch screens that might fail. And if there are smart features, they need to actually *work* and enhance the experience, not just be there for show. I'm actually leaning towards a different brand that's known for its quieter models, even if it means sacrificing some of the fancy digital presets."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "That's very helpful feedback on what's important to you moving forward. If COSORI were to address these issues \u2013 specifically the noise, cooking consistency, control responsiveness, and the non-stick coating's durability \u2013 what specific improvements would you suggest to make this a product you would reconsider or even recommend?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "For the noise, a completely redesigned fan system. It needs to be whisper-quiet, or at least comparable to a normal kitchen exhaust fan, not a jet. For consistency, a more robust and even heating element and air circulation design. Maybe multiple heating elements, or a better fan placement. For the controls, honestly, test them more thoroughly. Make sure they're durable and responsive for the long haul. And the non-stick... use a higher-quality, genuinely durable, and food-safe coating. Or, frankly, move to stainless steel crisper plates for certain parts, which might be easier to maintain and safer, even if it requires a bit more oil or different prep. But the flaking is just unacceptable for any price point, let alone one that's supposed to be a premium product."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Those are very concrete and actionable suggestions, West, and I truly appreciate you sharing them. They directly address the pain points you've experienced. Given everything we've discussed today, and considering your overall journey with the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being extremely dissatisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied, what would be your current satisfaction rating for this product?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "Hmm. Well, if I'm being brutally honest, and factoring in the frustration and the fact that I'm now looking to replace it so soon... I'd have to give it a 2. Maybe a 2.5 on a good day, but let's stick with 2. It started with promise, but it\u2019s just led to too much disappointment and now, concern."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "Thank you for that candid rating, West. We truly value your honesty, as difficult as it is to hear. Your detailed feedback today is incredibly important as we strive to improve our products and prevent other customers from having a similar experience. I want to personally thank you again for your time and for sharing your insights. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we conclude?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "West",
      "text": "No, I think I've covered everything. I just hope this feedback actually goes somewhere. It\u2019s frustrating to invest in something and have it fall so short of expectations, especially when those expectations were largely based on your company's promises."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "David",
      "text": "It absolutely will, West. Your feedback will be shared directly with our product development and quality assurance teams. We are genuinely committed to listening to our customers and making the necessary improvements. Thank you again for your time and candor."
    },
