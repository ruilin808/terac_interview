      "text": "** Hi Alex, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I\u2019m Jessica from Anker\u2019s product development team. We really appreciate you sharing your candid feedback about the Soundcore 2 speaker through your review, and we wanted to connect directly to understand your experience in a bit more depth."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Yeah, no problem, Jessica. Happy to chat. I mean, I really wanted to like the speaker, but, you know, it just didn't quite hit the mark for what I needed it for, unfortunately."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** I understand completely, and that's exactly why we're having this conversation. Your insights are incredibly valuable. In your review, you mentioned that you purchased the Soundcore 2 specifically for \"small outdoor gatherings and BBQs.\" Could you elaborate a bit on what prompted that particular need, and perhaps what alternatives you might have considered before deciding on the Soundcore 2?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Sure. So, I live here in San Jose, and the weather's great for most of the year. My partner and I, we like to host friends over, maybe once or twice a month, for a casual BBQ or just to hang out on the patio. We have a small backyard, nothing huge, but enough space for maybe six to eight people comfortably. I used to just, uh, bring out an old bookshelf speaker from inside, which worked okay, but it was clunky, you know, not really designed for outdoor use. And then the wires were always a hassle. I wanted something truly portable, waterproof if possible, that I could just set up quickly without a fuss."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That makes perfect sense. Convenience and portability for outdoor use. And what about alternatives? Did you look at other brands or models before landing on the Soundcore 2?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Yeah, definitely. I mean, I did some research online, looked at reviews, mostly on Amazon and some tech blogs. I saw a few JBLs, like the Flip series, and some from Ultimate Ears, too. But the Soundcore 2, it really stood out because of the price point, honestly. It seemed like a really good value for what it promised \u2013 12 watts, stereo sound, good battery life. And Anker, as a brand, I've had really positive experiences with your charging cables and power banks. I figured if Anker was doing speakers, they'd probably be solid. The positive buzz around Anker was definitely a factor."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's great to hear about your experience with our other products. So, you had a specific use case in mind \u2013 those outdoor gatherings \u2013 and the Soundcore 2's features, especially the 12W stereo sound and the price, seemed like a good fit for that. What were your initial expectations regarding the sound quality and volume for those events?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** I wasn't expecting, like, concert-level sound, you know? It's a compact speaker. But I thought it would be capable of filling my small patio with clear, enjoyable music, even with some conversation happening. You know, just enough to create a nice ambiance without having to crank it all the way up and blast everyone's ears. I expected it to be audible and present, not just background noise you have to strain to hear. A solid performer, like I said in the review."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** And that expectation seems to be where the disappointment set in, based on your review, particularly regarding the volume and distortion. Can you walk me through an instance where you first noticed this issue? What kind of music were you playing, and how did it feel when the sound started to deteriorate?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Oh, yeah. I remember pretty clearly. It was a Saturday, maybe a couple of weeks after I got it. We had a few friends over for a BBQ. I was really excited to finally use the speaker for its intended purpose. I had some classic rock playing, a bit of Led Zeppelin, some Fleetwood Mac \u2013 pretty dynamic stuff, but not super bass-heavy. I started it at a low volume, and it sounded pretty good, actually. Nice and clear. But once people started arriving, talking, laughing, I needed to turn it up. I pushed it past, I don't know, maybe 60%... and that's when it just fell apart."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** \"Fell apart\" \u2013 that's a strong phrase. Could you describe what you heard more specifically? You mentioned \"muddy bass\" and \"tinny highs\" in your review."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Yeah, exactly that. The bass, which was already, you know, not a strong point even at lower volumes, just completely lost all definition. It became this, like, boomy, indistinct blob of sound. And then the mids got harsh, really aggressive, and the highs just got shrill and piercing. But the worst part, by far, was the distortion. It wasn't just, uh, a loss of fidelity. It was an actual rattling, a crackling sound, like the drivers were struggling or maybe the housing couldn't handle the vibration. It was genuinely unpleasant. It made you want to just turn it off."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you're trying to host guests and create a good atmosphere. You also mentioned hip-hop and electronic music. Did those genres experience even worse distortion given their typical basslines?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Oh, absolutely. If I tried playing anything with a proper bassline \u2013 some hip-hop, like Kendrick Lamar, or electronic music, like something from Daft Punk \u2013 it was almost immediately unlistenable at anything above background volume. The bass would just completely distort and buzz. It felt like the speaker was trying to produce frequencies it simply wasn't equipped for, leading to that nasty crackling. It just couldn't handle the dynamic range."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** So, for your primary use case of providing music for small outdoor gatherings, the speaker ultimately couldn't deliver. How did you end up solving the problem during those events?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Well, that's the kicker, isn't it? I ended up having to go inside, unplug my old, clunky bookshelf speaker \u2013 a Yamaha, nothing fancy, probably ten years old \u2013 and bring *that* outside, find an extension cord, deal with the wires. Which, you know, completely defeated the whole purpose of buying a *portable* Bluetooth speaker in the first place. It was a hassle, and honestly, a bit embarrassing when I had guests over. I wanted the seamless experience, and I just didn't get it."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** I can certainly see why that would be frustrating and counterproductive to your initial goal. You mentioned the 12W claim felt misleading. Could you elaborate on why you felt that way?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Yeah, I mean, 12 watts, to me, implies a certain level of power, a capability to drive sound without it immediately falling apart. It suggests it can handle more than just quiet, personal listening. When I read \"12W stereo sound,\" I thought, \"Okay, this will be robust enough for a small gathering.\" But if it can't deliver those watts without sounding terrible, then the number itself doesn't really mean much in a practical sense. It sets an expectation that the product, for me, just didn't live up to in real-world use. It felt like it was rated at peak power that it couldn't sustain cleanly."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's a very clear point about the perception of specifications versus real-world performance. On the flip side, your review also mentioned some positives, particularly at lower volumes. Can you tell me more about those experiences? What did you like about the Soundcore 2 when it wasn't being pushed to higher volumes?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Oh, for sure. At really low volumes, like 30-40%, it sounds perfectly fine. The clarity is actually pretty good then. I've used it in the kitchen while doing dishes, listening to podcasts or some classical music. It's great for that. Or if I'm just reading in my study, and I want some quiet background music, it's perfectly adequate. The portability is genuinely good \u2013 it's compact, fits easily in a bag, and the battery life *at those lower volumes* is actually quite decent. I haven't had it die on me when I'm just using it for a couple of hours around the house quietly. And the build quality, it feels sturdy, like it could handle being knocked around a bit, which is a plus."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** So, for quiet, personal listening, it hits the mark, offering good clarity and convenience. How frequently do you find yourself using it in those low-volume scenarios compared to the higher-volume social settings?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Hmm, that's a good question. I'd say I use it in the low-volume, personal way maybe three or four times a week. It's become my go-to for background noise when I'm doing chores or just chilling. But for the social events, the BBQs, which was the *main* reason I bought it, it\u2019s practically never used for music anymore. I might take it out for, like, a quick podcast if I'm tidying up before guests arrive, but as soon as the party starts, it's back to the old Yamaha. So, it's definitely not fulfilling its primary intended purpose."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's really helpful context, Alex. Knowing it's great for personal listening but fails for its main purchase motivation. Thinking about the price you paid for the Soundcore 2 \u2013 given your current experience, how do you feel about its value now?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Honestly, for what I use it for now \u2013 a quiet personal speaker \u2013 it feels a bit overpriced. I mean, I paid around fifty bucks, I think? For a dedicated personal listening device, I probably could have found something similar, or even better for that specific use, for less. Or, if I'd known it would only be good for that, I might have just saved up and put that money towards a speaker that *could* actually handle the volume I need for gatherings. So, the value perception has definitely shifted downwards. It's become a niche product in my home, not the versatile speaker I thought I was getting."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** Understood. If you were to give Anker a single piece of advice for improving the Soundcore 2, or designing a future Soundcore 3, what would be the number one change you'd suggest to address your experience?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Without a doubt, it would be to address the distortion at higher volumes. Either engineer it to actually handle those 12 watts cleanly, or honestly, if that's not possible in that form factor, then just market it differently. Don't call it a \"party speaker\" or imply it can fill a room if it can't. Just make it clear it's for personal, low-volume listening. But ideally, I'd want a version that can be turned up to 80-90% without sounding like it's tearing itself apart. I'd even pay a little more for that."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's very direct and clear feedback, Alex. So, if we were able to significantly improve the high-volume clarity and bass response without distortion, making it a truly capable speaker for small gatherings, would that be enough to make you consider Anker again for a portable speaker, or even recommend it to others?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Yeah, absolutely. If Anker could genuinely fix that core issue, I would be back in a heartbeat. Because the *other* features \u2013 the portability, the battery life at reasonable volumes, the solid build, the Anker brand reliability \u2013 those are all still really appealing. If you could marry those strengths with actual usable volume and clear sound, then yeah, I'd recommend it. I'd say, \"Hey, Anker finally cracked it.\" But as it stands, I can only recommend it for very specific, quiet use, and I have to explicitly warn people off if they want it for anything social or dynamic."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's a very honest assessment, and thank you for that. Just a couple more questions. If a competitor came out with a speaker around the same price point, with similar portability and battery life, but with demonstrably superior performance at higher volumes and no distortion, how likely would you be to switch to that competitor?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Very likely, honestly. As a buyer, I'm always looking for the best value and performance for my needs. The Anker brand goodwill only goes so far if the product doesn't perform its core function. I'd probably still look at Anker's offerings first, out of habit and prior positive experience, but if a competitor clearly had a better solution for my specific use case, I wouldn't hesitate to switch. Especially if it was around the same price. I'm willing to pay a bit more for quality, but I won't pay for something that just doesn't work as advertised."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's really clear. Alex, this has been incredibly insightful. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your detailed experience. Just one final question, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being extremely dissatisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied, what would be your overall satisfaction rating with the Anker Soundcore 2, considering all aspects of your experience?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 34,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** Hmm. Given my main reason for purchase and how it ultimately failed there, but also considering its decent performance for quiet listening... I'd have to say a **4 out of 10**. It's not a complete bust because it *does* work, just not for what I needed it for, and the distortion issue is a pretty major flaw."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 35,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** A 4 out of 10. Thank you for that honest rating, Alex. This feedback is invaluable to us. We\u2019re constantly working to improve our products, and your comments will definitely be taken into consideration as we develop future iterations. Thank you again for your time and for being an Anker customer."
    },

      "turnId": 36,
      "speaker": "**Alex",
      "text": "** You're welcome, Jessica. I hope it helps. I really do like a lot of your other stuff, so I'm rooting for you guys to get this one right."
    },
