      "text": "** Hi Benjamin, thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Jessica, and I'm calling from COWIN. We really appreciate you sharing your feedback with us, even when it's critical. It\u2019s incredibly valuable for us to understand our customers' experiences, and your detailed review of the E7 headphones really stood out."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 2,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Uh, yeah, no problem. I mean, I figured it was important to be, like, honest. I was pretty bummed out by those headphones."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 3,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** We definitely hear that, and we want to understand exactly what happened. This call is just for us to learn, so please feel free to be completely candid. There are no right or wrong answers. We're hoping to dive a little deeper into your experience. First off, could you tell me a bit more about what initially led you to choose the COWIN E7 headphones? What were you hoping they'd do for you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Yeah, for sure. So, I had this big long-haul flight coming up \u2013 like, from Dallas to, uh, Amsterdam, actually. And I just knew I couldn't deal with the engine noise and, you know, just all the general cabin noise, especially if there were, like, screaming kids or whatever. I really wanted some quiet, and I'd heard good things about active noise cancellation, but all the big brands, like Bose or Sony, were just way out of my budget. I was looking for something that could do the job without, like, breaking the bank, you know? The E7s seemed to offer ANC at a pretty good price point, so I went for it."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That makes perfect sense. Long flights can definitely be a challenge without good noise cancellation. Did you consider any other specific brands or models around that same price point before you settled on the E7s?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Hmm, I looked at a few on Amazon, you know, just scrolling through. There were some other brands, I can't remember the names exactly, but they all looked kinda similar. The E7s just had a lot of reviews, even if some were mixed, and the price just hit that sweet spot for me. I figured, \"Hey, ANC for this much? Can't be that bad, right?\" I was mostly comparing based on price and the ANC feature."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** Got it. So, the promise of ANC at that value was a primary driver. You mentioned in your review that the issues started \"from day one.\" Could you walk me through what that initial experience was like when you first unboxed them and tried to set them up?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Oh man, yeah. So I took them out of the box, charged 'em up, all good. Then I tried to pair them with my phone \u2013 I've got, like, an iPhone 14 Pro. And it just... wouldn't. My phone wouldn't even recognize them half the time. I kept, like, holding the button down, turning them off and on, forgetting the device, trying again. It probably took me, like, fifteen minutes, maybe even twenty, just to get them to show up and connect the first time. I was already a bit annoyed, to be honest. It shouldn't be that hard. I've had, like, cheap earbuds and even a Bluetooth speaker that connected faster."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially for a first impression. Once you finally got them paired, you noted that the connection dropped constantly. Can you describe some specific scenarios where this happened? You mentioned not being able to walk more than five feet away, and even with your phone in your pocket."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Yeah, exactly. So, say I'm, like, in my kitchen listening to a podcast while I make some food. My phone would be on the counter, right? If I walk, like, three steps to the fridge, boom, it cuts out. Total silence. Or, if I'm, like, at work, which is a sales job so I'm moving around a bit, I'll have my phone in my front pocket, and it's constantly sputtering and breaking up. It's like, \"What's the point of wireless headphones if I have to be tethered to my phone anyway?\" It made listening to anything just... impossible. I tried to use them on the DART train here in Dallas, too, and same thing \u2013 constantly cutting out even with my phone right next to me."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's a huge problem for convenience and usability. It sounds like it completely undermined the wireless aspect. You also mentioned that it was even worse on the plane, to the point where you gave up. Can you elaborate on that experience during your flight?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Oh, the plane was a nightmare. I was really hoping the ANC would kick in there, but mostly I was just battling the Bluetooth. It was just constantly cutting out, way worse than anywhere else. I don't know if it was, like, interference from other devices or what, but it was just unlistenable. I\u2019d get, like, five seconds of music, then it would drop for ten, then come back for two. I eventually just took them off, put them back in my bag, and dug out my old wired earbuds that came with my last iPhone. They didn't have ANC, obviously, but at least the sound was *constant*."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** Wow, that really defeats the purpose of buying them for a flight. So, moving on to the active noise cancellation feature itself, you described it as a \"cruel joke\" and mentioned a \"faint, irritating hiss.\" Could you tell me more about that hiss? Was it constant when ANC was on? And what specific noises were you hoping it would reduce that it simply didn't?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Yeah, the hiss was definitely constant, almost like a really low static sound when the ANC was switched on. It was barely noticeable if, like, music was blasting, but when the music was quieter or between tracks, it was definitely there and just annoying. As for what it didn't cancel... well, everything, basically. I was expecting it to at least, like, dull the engine hum on the plane, you know? Or when I was walking downtown, dampen the traffic noise. But literally, I could still hear everything. Conversations from rows away on the plane, the engine roar felt almost the same, cars honking, street chatter \u2013 none of it was significantly quieter. It just felt like I was wearing, uh, regular headphones with a faint hiss. My cheap foam earplugs genuinely did a better job, which is pretty sad."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's incredibly disappointing when the core feature you bought them for doesn't perform. You said it made \"zero difference\" to your listening experience. What did you *expect* for the price point? Were you hoping for complete silence, or a noticeable reduction?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** I wasn't expecting, like, total silence like those super expensive ones. I know those are in a different league. But I was hoping for, like, maybe a 50% or 60% reduction in background noise. Enough that I could actually, like, focus on my music or audiobook without constantly being distracted by the outside world. Just enough to make a real difference, not just introduce a new annoying sound. I just wanted to feel like it was *doing something*."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** I understand. A tangible, noticeable reduction, not just a subtle change. Let's talk about the audio quality next. You described it as \"muddy,\" \"boomy bass,\" and \"harsh highs.\" Can you give me a bit more detail on that? What kind of music or audio did you mostly listen to, and how did these characteristics impact your enjoyment?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Mostly I listen to, like, hip-hop, R&B, some pop, and then podcasts or audiobooks. For the music, the bass was just... overpowering sometimes, but not in a good way. It was just a muddy thud, not a clean, punchy bass. It sounded kinda muffled, like someone had put a blanket over the speakers. The vocals, especially in R&B, just felt distant, like the singer was in another room. And then, uh, the highs, like cymbals or certain synth sounds, would just feel really sharp and almost painful after a while. It just made everything sound flat and lifeless, you know? Not exciting at all. For podcasts, it was okay, but the harshness sometimes made it uncomfortable for longer listens."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That sounds like a very unbalanced sound profile. You also mentioned experiencing listening fatigue quickly. How long could you comfortably wear them and listen before you felt that fatigue setting in?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Um, probably like, thirty minutes to an hour, maybe? Before my ears just felt kinda tired, almost ringing a bit from the harshness. And that's if the Bluetooth even *stayed connected* for that long, which it usually didn't. So it was a double whammy, really. Bad sound, and then it would cut out anyway."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** I see. That significantly limits their usability for any extended period. Let's shift to the physical design for a moment. You brought up the buttons on the earcup, calling them \"poorly designed\" and difficult to distinguish by touch. Can you recall any specific instances where this was a major frustration?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Oh yeah, all the time. They're all kinda the same shape, just small bumps, and they're too close together. So I'd be trying to, like, turn up the volume, and instead, I'd skip a track. Or I'd try to skip, and I'd accidentally pause. The worst was when I was trying to turn up the volume, and I'd accidentally hit the ANC switch and turn it off or on, which was pointless anyway, but still annoying. It's just hard to feel which button is which without taking the headphones off and looking, which you shouldn't have to do."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That definitely impacts the user experience and can be quite jarring. Now, on a slightly different note, you did mention one \"silver lining\" being their comfort \"for short periods.\" Could you expand on that? What made them comfortable, and what defined a \"short period\" before that comfort started to diminish?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Yeah, so when I first put them on, they felt pretty soft on the ears, and the clamping force wasn't, like, too tight. They felt generally okay. But after, like, an hour or so, maybe an hour and a half, my ears would start to get warm, and they just felt a bit heavy. The cushions felt good initially, but then they'd start to flatten a bit, and I could feel the plastic underneath. So, for, like, a quick 30-minute podcast, they were fine, but anything longer, they just weren't really ideal. Though, again, the other issues overshadowed this completely."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** So, initial comfort was there, but it didn't last for longer listening sessions. You also briefly mentioned battery life as \"okay for the few periods I managed to keep them connected.\" Did you ever get a sense of how long they *could* last if the connectivity wasn't an issue? An estimate, perhaps?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Uh, it's hard to say for sure, because the Bluetooth was such a mess. I never really got to fully drain them in one go because the connection would always break first. But from what I could tell, like, if I used them for an hour, then another hour, then another, it seemed like they would probably last, like, 10-12 hours with ANC on before needing a charge. But that's just a guess, because it was so rare I actually got to use them for extended periods without interruption. It was never the battery life that was the problem, it was everything else."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** Thanks for that estimate. It helps us understand that the battery wasn't the primary failure point. Considering all these issues you've experienced \u2013 the Bluetooth, the ANC, the audio quality, the buttons \u2013 how do you now feel about the price you paid for these headphones? Did they offer any value to you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Honestly, no. I feel like I just wasted my money. Even if they were, like, fifty bucks, I'd still be annoyed. I paid, I think, around eighty or ninety, something like that? And for that, I expected them to at least *function*. Like, the basic stuff \u2013 staying connected, actually canceling *some* noise. It feels like I threw that money down the drain. I basically just ended up buying some expensive wired earbuds because I had to resort to those."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's completely understandable. It sounds like they fundamentally failed to meet your basic expectations for a functional pair of headphones. Given your experience, what would it take for you to consider purchasing another COWIN product in the future, if anything? Or, perhaps, what kind of improvements would make you reconsider the E7s specifically?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** For me to buy another COWIN product? Hmm, I'd probably need to see some really strong, consistent reviews from a lot of people saying the Bluetooth is rock solid and the ANC actually *works*. Like, truly works, not just a gimmick. As for the E7s specifically, you'd have to completely overhaul the Bluetooth antenna or chip or whatever, so it actually holds a connection. And the ANC needs to be, like, significantly better, not just a hiss generator. Also, the sound quality definitely needs to be cleaned up, less muddy. And the buttons \u2013 make them distinct, so I can tell them apart by touch. I mean, if all that was fixed, *maybe*, but after this experience, I'd be super hesitant."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's very clear feedback, Benjamin. You're looking for fundamental reliability and effective core features. If you were to give advice to someone else looking for headphones for similar use cases \u2013 like travel, daily commutes \u2013 would you recommend the COWIN E7s as they are today? And if not, what would you tell them to look for instead?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Absolutely not. I'd tell them to save their money, or save up *more* money for a different brand entirely. I'd tell them, \"Do not waste your money on these.\" I'd say to really focus on reviews that talk about strong, stable Bluetooth and effective ANC. Even if it means spending a bit more, it's worth it for something that actually works. I mean, I ended up having to buy another pair of headphones anyway, so I basically spent double. So, like, don't make my mistake, just get a better brand from the start."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "**Jessica",
      "text": "** That's a strong message. It sounds like the overall lack of functionality outweighed any potential initial cost savings. Finally, Benjamin, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is \"extremely dissatisfied\" and 10 is \"extremely satisfied,\" how would you rate your overall satisfaction with the COWIN E7 headphones, based on your entire experience?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 34,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Uh... a 1. Definitely a 1. They were pretty much useless for what I bought them for."

We genuinely appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences, especially the frustrations you've faced. This information will be directly used by our product development and engineering teams. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add before we conclude?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 36,
      "speaker": "**Benjamin",
      "text": "** Nah, I think I pretty much covered it all. Just, uh, hope you guys can actually make some changes based on what I said."
