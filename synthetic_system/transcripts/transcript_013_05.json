      "text": "Good morning, Barbara. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Mike, and I\u2019m a customer insights representative from TIJN. We really appreciate you sharing your experience with our blue light blocking glasses, and we'd love to delve a little deeper into your feedback. Is now still a good time for you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 2,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Good morning, Mike. Yes, absolutely, it is. The kids are at school, so I have a little peace and quiet for a change. Happy to chat."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 3,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Fantastic. Well, first off, thank you for your candid review. It gives us a lot to think about. You mentioned late-night screen exposure often left your eyes feeling tired and dry, and you struggled to wind down. Can you walk me through a typical evening before you got these glasses? What was that experience like, and what finally made you decide to try a solution like blue light blocking glasses?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Oh, gosh, yeah. Uh, well, it's pretty standard, I think, for a lot of parents. The kids are finally asleep, and that's when my \"me time\" or \"catch-up time\" really begins, usually around nine, nine-thirty. So, I'd grab my phone, sometimes the laptop, and just... scroll, you know? Catch up on emails, see what's happening on Instagram, maybe watch an episode of something on Netflix. And I'd be doing that for two, three, sometimes four hours. But by the time I put the device down, my eyes would just ache. Like, a dull throb, and they'd feel so gritty and dry, almost like I'd been swimming in chlorinated water. And then trying to sleep? Forget it. My brain would still be buzzing, and I'd just lie there, staring at the ceiling. I just felt like I needed *something* to cut down on that harshness. I mean, I love my screens, but they were definitely taking a toll."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That sounds really challenging, Barbara. It's a common story we hear. So, when you decided to look for a solution, what were you hoping these glasses would specifically address for you? And why these particular TIJN frames? Were you looking at other options, perhaps screen filters or different brands?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Well, honestly, the sleep thing was the biggest driver. I really wanted to be able to wind down more easily. And then the eye fatigue, of course. I mean, if they could help with both, that would be amazing. I didn't really look at screen filters, to be honest. I just kind of jumped to the glasses idea. As for *these* specific TIJN frames, a couple of things stood out. First, the style. I'm fifty, but I still want to feel, you know, a little current. The square, \"nerd\" aesthetic you guys have? It just looked really chic and understated, something I wouldn't mind wearing even if I wasn't just at home. And obviously, the non-prescription aspect was key. And then the price. They were very budget-friendly. I figured if they didn't work, it wasn't a huge investment, you know? It felt like a low-risk way to try out the concept."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I understand. The style and affordability as a good entry point. You mentioned the packaging was quite basic. When you first unboxed them, did that initial impression, coupled with the lightweight feel of the frames, affect your expectations of the product right away?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Hmm, that\u2019s a good question. Not really, to be honest. I mean, the cloth pouch and cleaning cloth were fine. What *did* make an impression was picking them up. They felt incredibly light, almost too light. Which, initially, was like, \"Oh, great, they won't feel heavy on my face!\" But then, almost immediately, I thought, \"Is this going to hold up?\" You know? When you spend a bit more on something, you expect a certain heft, a certain solidity. These felt a bit... disposable, maybe? Not in a negative way initially, but it did make me wonder about their longevity. I definitely appreciate things that are well-made and durable, even if I'm not paying top dollar."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That makes perfect sense, a classic pro and con of a lightweight design. You touched on durability there. Have you had any instances where that concern about the thin plastic or less sturdy hinges has actually come into play? Have they been dropped, for example, or has anything happened that made you think, \"Ah, this is where that flimsy feeling comes from\"?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Uh, thankfully, no major incidents yet! *laughs* No drops or crushes, touch wood. But I am definitely more careful with them than I would be with, say, a pair of sunglasses from a higher-end brand. When I take them off, I'm always very deliberate, putting them in the pouch immediately. I wouldn't just toss them on the counter or into my bag without thinking. It's more of an ongoing, underlying concern rather than something that's happened already. I just feel like if one of the kids accidentally grabbed them, or if they slipped off my lap onto a hard floor, that would probably be the end of them."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I appreciate that insight into your handling behavior. It tells us a lot about perceived durability. Now, regarding the yellow tint, you noted it was immediately noticeable and warmed up screens significantly. You found it fine for casual browsing but distracting for color-accurate tasks. Could you give me some specific examples of where the tint was truly a benefit versus where it became a real hindrance?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Oh, absolutely. The benefit side is easy: reading e-books on my tablet, watching Netflix on my phone, just general social media scrolling. For those, it actually felt like a soft, warm filter over the screen, if that makes sense? It almost made everything feel calmer, less intense. My eyes relaxed into it, I think. But then, when I was trying to do things like... I was looking for a new throw pillow for the living room online, comparing different shades of blue and gray. Or when I was looking at craft ideas, trying to match yarn colors or paint swatches. That yellow tint just threw everything off. The blues didn't look right, the whites looked creamy, and it became impossible to accurately judge color. So, I\u2019d take them off, look at the screen, put them back on, take them off again. It became more of a nuisance then, and I just ended up taking them off completely for those tasks."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That\u2019s a very clear distinction, Barbara, thank you. So, for tasks where color fidelity is important, they're not ideal. How often would you say you encounter those kinds of color-sensitive tasks in your typical evening screen time? Is it a frequent occurrence, or more occasional?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "It\u2019s more occasional, actually. My evenings are mostly for relaxation and catching up, so it's probably 80% casual browsing, movies, reading. The color-sensitive stuff pops up maybe once or twice a week, usually if I'm doing some online shopping or planning a project. So, it's not a deal-breaker for me, but it is something I notice."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Okay, that helps us understand the impact. Let's move to comfort. You said they were generally good for a few hours, but after three to four hours, you felt tenderness on your nose bridge and pressure behind your ears, and they tended to slide down. Can you describe that feeling of discomfort a bit more? Is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or more of a persistent irritation?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "It\u2019s definitely not sharp pain, thank goodness. It's more like a dull ache, a persistent irritation, exactly. For the nose bridge, it\u2019s where those molded plastic pads sit. It\u2019s not soft, you know? So, after a while, it just feels like something is pressing on that one spot. And the ears, it's a similar thing. The arms just feel like they\u2019re hugging a little too tightly, not painfully, but enough to make you aware of it. And the sliding\u2026 that's mostly when I'm looking down at my phone in bed. I'll be lying there, scrolling, and they'll just slowly creep down my nose. I have to push them back up every few minutes. It just breaks your concentration, you know? It's not the end of the world, but it takes away from that \"forget you're wearing them\" experience."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Absolutely. Those little interruptions can add up. You mentioned you've been wearing them for about a month now, primarily in the evenings. And you described the effectiveness as a \"subtle comfort enhancement\" rather than a \"revolutionary solution.\" Could you elaborate on that a bit? What were your initial hopes for a \"revolutionary solution,\" and where do you feel these glasses fell short of those expectations?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Well, my hopes were probably a bit ambitious, I'll admit. *chuckles* I think I was secretly hoping for a miracle! I wanted to put them on, and suddenly, my eyes would feel completely refreshed, like I hadn't been staring at a screen for hours. And that my brain would just switch off as soon as I took them off, and I\u2019d drift right to sleep. So, the \"revolutionary solution\" in my mind was zero eye strain, falling asleep instantly, and waking up feeling super rested. What I got was... a very slight reduction in the harshness. My eyes *might* feel a little less fatigued, but it\u2019s not a night-and-day difference. I still get dry eyes sometimes, and my sleep hasn't really improved dramatically. I still have nights where I struggle to wind down. So, it\u2019s not that they do *nothing*, it\u2019s just that the impact is much, much smaller than I had, perhaps unrealistically, hoped for. It feels like a very minor assist, like turning the screen brightness down just a tiny bit, rather than a significant protective barrier."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I appreciate your honesty there, Barbara. It helps us understand the gap between expectation and reality. Given your experience, if TIJN were to offer a \"premium\" version of these glasses, perhaps at a higher price point, what would be the one or two features or improvements that would make you seriously consider investing in them? What would justify that higher price for you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Oh, that's easy. Durability, definitely. I mean, if they felt substantial, like they could withstand normal wear and tear, even a minor drop, that would be a huge plus. I\u2019d want to pick them up and feel like they\u2019re built to last, not like they might snap. And then, the comfort. If you could somehow design the nose pads to be softer, maybe adjustable, or just a different material that doesn't create pressure points after a few hours. And the arms, too, to have less clamping pressure. If they were truly comfortable for *extended* wear, say, four, five, six hours, to the point where I genuinely forgot I was wearing them, that would be worth paying more for. The effectiveness is harder to judge without more robust claims, but if it came with that increased durability and comfort, I\u2019d be much more inclined to believe in the other benefits. Oh, and maybe a less noticeable tint that still does the job? That would be a bonus, but comfort and durability are definitely top."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Excellent feedback on the durability and comfort, especially the specific pain points. That's very actionable for us. You mentioned earlier that the original glasses were \"budget-friendly\" and a \"reasonable 'try-it-out' item.\" Given your personal income level, which we understand is quite comfortable, how does that influence your perception of \"budget-friendly\" for a product like this? Does it mean you expect less, or that you're just willing to try more things without much financial risk?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Hmm, that\u2019s a good point. It\u2019s not that I expect less, exactly. It\u2019s more that for something like this, a non-prescription pair of glasses, I wasn\u2019t looking to spend hundreds of dollars. I mean, my prescription glasses are a significant investment, so for something supplemental, I was looking for good value. \"Budget-friendly\" means I\u2019m not throwing away money on something that might not work. So, if they were, say, $100, I'd probably have been much more critical of the flimsy feel and the comfort issues. But for the price point they\u2019re at, it felt like a fair exchange for what they offered. It allowed me to try out the concept without buyer's remorse, if that makes sense. I was willing to accept some compromises for the lower price, but I still expected them to *do* something."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That clarity on value perception is very helpful, Barbara. It sounds like a lower price encourages experimentation, but core functionality and reasonable quality are still key. One final question for you: Considering your overall experience, from purchase to a month of use, how likely would you be to recommend these specific TIJN blue light blocking glasses to a friend or family member, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not at all likely and 10 being extremely likely?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Oh, that's a good one. Um... I'd say probably a 6."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "A 6. And what's behind that number, if you don't mind me asking?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Well, the style is great, and they\u2019re definitely affordable, which I think a lot of people appreciate. So, for someone who just wants to *try* blue light glasses without spending a lot, and who doesn't mind a subtle tint and isn't looking for a dramatic effect, then yeah, they're a decent entry-level option. But I wouldn't recommend them as a miracle cure or if someone was looking for really robust, long-lasting comfort or absolute clarity for color-sensitive work. It\u2019s a very qualified recommendation, if that makes sense. They're good for what they are at that price, but they're not for everyone, and they definitely have their limitations."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's a very clear and fair assessment, Barbara. A 6 with those important qualifications is very valuable feedback for us. We really appreciate your time and your honest insights today. This conversation will be incredibly helpful as we look to improve our products in the future. Thank you again."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "You're very welcome, Mike. Glad I could help."
