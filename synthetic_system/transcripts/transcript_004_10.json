    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Yeah, absolutely. I guess, well, there were a few things. First off, honestly, it was the cost. You know, I'm a consultant, but my income can be a bit\u2026 variable, let's just say. So, spending money on what I thought might just be another kitchen gadget, something that would sit on the counter and collect dust, felt like a big risk. I already have a pretty small kitchen, living here in Austin, and counter space is precious. So, it needed to earn its keep, if that makes sense."

I\u2019d seen some friends post about theirs, but you know how social media is \u2013 everything always looks perfect. So, it was a combination of the price point and just general skepticism, I guess. What really pushed me over was, well, so many friends kept raving about *their* air fryers, and a couple of them specifically mentioned the COSORI Pro II. They really vouched for the capacity, which was important for my family of three, and how easy it was to clean. That's what sealed the deal, ultimately."

That was impressive. But what really blew me away were the chicken wings. My homemade wings, you know, I used to deep fry them sometimes, or bake them, but they were never quite right. But in the COSORI? Perfectly golden, crunchy skin, juicy inside, and so much less mess and oil. That\u2019s when I thought, \"Okay, this isn't just a gadget.

      "text": "** Okay, so, for my family of three \u2013 myself, my partner, and our little one \u2013 the 5.8-quart is just right. I can do a good batch of chicken tenders or wings for dinner, or a whole bag of frozen veggies, like broccoli or sweet potato fries, without having to do it in multiple rounds, which is a huge time-saver. And when we have friends over \u2013 which, you know, being in Austin, there's always a reason for a gathering \u2013 it's amazing for appetizers. Like, I\u2019ll throw in some spring rolls, or jalape\u00f1o poppers, or even a smaller batch of those chicken wings.

      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Hmm, \"daily\" is probably an exaggeration for every single day, but definitely four, maybe five times a week? Sometimes twice a day if I'm reheating leftovers for lunch. It\u2019s become my go-to for dinner sides, like roasting asparagus or Brussels sprouts, and a lot of our protein too. It\u2019s just so much faster and less fuss than preheating the big oven, especially in the summer here."

With the air fryer, I can get that really satisfying crispy texture without all the added fat. It makes vegetables so much more appealing \u2013 my kid will actually eat roasted broccoli now because it has a little char and crunch. And for us, it's about being able to enjoy things like \"fried chicken\" or \"fries\" without the guilt or the heavy feeling afterward. It feels like a healthier way to cook, which is important for us, especially with a young child."

    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Oh, it\u2019s a dream. Seriously, it really is. Most of the time, I just let it cool down, then take a sponge with some warm, soapy water, and a quick wipe usually does the trick. Everything just slides off because of the non-stick coating. And for those times when I'm feeling lazy, or if something gets a little stuck, it just goes straight into the dishwasher. That's a *major* convenience. Honestly, if it were a pain to clean, I probably wouldn't use it half as much. That's a deal-breaker for me with kitchen appliances."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That's really valuable feedback, Betty. Ease of cleanup is definitely a key factor in appliance usage. You also mentioned a couple of minor points in your review \u2013 the audible fan noise and the desire for a dedicated recipe app. Let's start with the fan noise. You said it\u2019s \"comparable to a microwave or a quiet range hood.\" Has there ever been a time when you found the fan noise genuinely disruptive or louder than you'd prefer?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Hmm, disruptive? No, not really. I mean, it\u2019s there, you notice it, but it\u2019s definitely not like a jet engine or anything. It blends into the general kitchen sounds. If I'm trying to have a really quiet conversation right next to it, maybe, but that\u2019s not usually where I\u2019m standing when it\u2019s running. So, no, I wouldn\u2019t call it a pain point. More like, just acknowledging it\u2019s not silent, you know? It's a minor nitpick, really, not something that would make me use it less or regret the purchase."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** Okay, that\u2019s a very helpful distinction. It sounds like it\u2019s within acceptable limits for a countertop appliance. And then, regarding the idea of a dedicated COSORI recipe app for this specific model, what kind of content would you hope to see there? Are you looking for specific meal ideas, cooking tips, or perhaps a community aspect?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Oh, definitely specific meal ideas! When I first got it, I was doing a lot of Googling, like \"air fryer chicken wings recipe\" or \"air fryer roasted sweet potatoes.\" The pre-programmed settings are great for the basics, but sometimes I want to get a little more adventurous. I\u2019d love to see, like, maybe recipes for different cuisines, or more complex dishes that I wouldn't think to make in an air fryer."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** Interesting. So, expanding beyond the basic functions?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Yeah, exactly! And maybe tips for adapting regular recipes to the air fryer. Or even, um, suggestions for specific accessories, if you guys have those. It\u2019s like, I know it can do a lot, but sometimes I just need that spark, that specific recipe that shows me how. Right now, I mostly wing it or look up general air fryer recipes online, but a COSORI-specific one would just feel more... curated, I guess? Like, knowing it's tested for *my* machine. That would be really cool."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That makes perfect sense. Curated and tested recipes for the specific model would definitely build confidence and encourage more varied usage. Thank you for that excellent suggestion. Now, you\u2019ve clearly found a lot of value in the Pro II. Given your initial hesitation about investing in a new appliance, how do you now perceive the price and overall value of the COSORI Pro II? Do you feel it\u2019s been a good return on your investment?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Oh, absolutely. One hundred percent. At first, like I said, I was hesitant because of my budget, thinking, \"Do I really *need* this?\" But honestly, it's paid for itself in so many ways. I'm cooking more at home, which saves us money on eating out. We're eating healthier, which, you know, you can't put a price on long-term health. And the sheer convenience and time-saving aspect \u2013 especially for a busy consultant like me, even if the income isn't always super high, my time is still valuable. So, yeah, the value is definitely there. It's not just a convenience; it's genuinely improved our home cooking."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That\u2019s wonderful to hear that it's delivering such significant value across multiple aspects of your life. Thinking about alternatives, before you got the air fryer, how were you typically preparing foods that you now cook in the COSORI, like those crispy chicken wings or roasted vegetables? What was that experience like in comparison?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Well, for things like chicken wings, it was either deep-frying, which was a huge mess, took forever to heat the oil, and then the cleanup was just awful. Or, I\u2019d bake them, and they\u2019d come out\u2026 okay, but never truly crispy. Just kind of soft. Roasted veggies usually went in the conventional oven, and while they were good, it took longer to preheat, and they didn\u2019t get that lovely char and tenderness that the air fryer achieves so quickly. And leftovers? Microwaved pizza is just sad. This is completely different. It\u2019s faster, less messy, and the results are consistently better. My regular oven just feels\u2026 slow now, especially for smaller batches."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** So, it sounds like the COSORI Pro II has not only replaced but significantly upgraded your cooking methods for many items. And considering your positive experience, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is \"not at all likely\" and 10 is \"extremely likely,\" how likely are you to recommend the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer to friends or family?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Oh, definitely a 10. A solid 10. I already do recommend it! When friends come over and I make something in it, they\u2019re always impressed, and I tell them, \"You have to get this specific one!\""
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That's fantastic. And what are the key reasons you\u2019d give for that strong recommendation? What are the top two or three things you highlight to them?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Okay, so, first, the performance. I tell them it actually *does* what it says it will. Crispy food, less oil, perfect every time. No more soggy fries or just \"okay\" roasted veggies. Second, the ease of use and cleanup. It\u2019s so intuitive, and it\u2019s genuinely easy to clean, which, like I said, is a huge factor for me. And third, just the versatility and how much it simplifies cooking. It\u2019s just become such a core part of my kitchen that I genuinely believe everyone should have one. It saves time, makes healthy eating easier, and honestly, it\u2019s just fun to use."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 34,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That\u2019s a powerful endorsement, Betty. We really appreciate that. Now, let\u2019s think hypothetically for a moment. What, if anything, would make you consider switching to a competitor's air fryer in the future? Are there any specific features or performance improvements that would tempt you away from COSORI?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 35,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Hmm, that\u2019s a tough one, because I really am happy with this one. I guess\u2026 maybe if a competitor came out with something that had *significantly* more advanced smart features. Like, true integration with a really robust recipe app, or maybe some kind of self-cleaning function \u2013 though I don't know how realistic that is. Or, if it was significantly quieter while still maintaining the same performance and capacity."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 36,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** So, either a big leap in smart technology, an unprecedented convenience feature, or a substantial reduction in noise while maintaining performance. That gives us a good benchmark."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 37,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Yeah, exactly. But honestly, it would have to be a pretty big leap. I mean, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019d never switch, but it would take a lot for me to give up my current COSORI. I\u2019m pretty loyal when something works this well."

Just one final question to round things out: If you had to rate your overall satisfaction with your COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, from 1 to 10, with 1 being completely unsatisfied and 10 being absolutely delighted, what would that rating be?"

It feels like a healthier way to cook, which is important for us, especially with a young child."

Everything just slides off because of the non-stick coating. And for those times when I'm feeling lazy, or if something gets a little stuck, it just goes straight into the dishwasher. That's a *major* convenience. Honestly, if it were a pain to clean, I probably wouldn't use it half as much. That's a deal-breaker for me with kitchen appliances."

You also mentioned a couple of minor points in your review \u2013 the audible fan noise and the desire for a dedicated recipe app. Let's start with the fan noise. You said it\u2019s \"comparable to a microwave or a quiet range hood.\" Has there ever been a time when you found the fan noise genuinely disruptive or louder than you'd prefer?"

If I'm trying to have a really quiet conversation right next to it, maybe, but that\u2019s not usually where I\u2019m standing when it\u2019s running. So, no, I wouldn\u2019t call it a pain point. More like, just acknowledging it\u2019s not silent, you know? It's a minor nitpick, really, not something that would make me use it less or regret the purchase."

When I first got it, I was doing a lot of Googling, like \"air fryer chicken wings recipe\" or \"air fryer roasted sweet potatoes.\" The pre-programmed settings are great for the basics, but sometimes I want to get a little more adventurous. I\u2019d love to see, like, maybe recipes for different cuisines, or more complex dishes that I wouldn't think to make in an air fryer."

It\u2019s like, I know it can do a lot, but sometimes I just need that spark, that specific recipe that shows me how. Right now, I mostly wing it or look up general air fryer recipes online, but a COSORI-specific one would just feel more... curated, I guess? Like, knowing it's tested for *my* machine. That would be really cool."

Thank you for that excellent suggestion. Now, you\u2019ve clearly found a lot of value in the Pro II.

At first, like I said, I was hesitant because of my budget, thinking, \"Do I really *need* this?\" But honestly, it's paid for itself in so many ways. I'm cooking more at home, which saves us money on eating out. We're eating healthier, which, you know, you can't put a price on long-term health. And the sheer convenience and time-saving aspect \u2013 especially for a busy consultant like me, even if the income isn't always super high, my time is still valuable. So, yeah, the value is definitely there. It's not just a convenience; it's genuinely improved our home cooking."

Thinking about alternatives, before you got the air fryer, how were you typically preparing foods that you now cook in the COSORI, like those crispy chicken wings or roasted vegetables? What was that experience like in comparison?"

      "turnId": 70,
      "speaker": "**Betty",
      "text": "** Well, for things like chicken wings, it was either deep-frying, which was a huge mess, took forever to heat the oil, and then the cleanup was just awful. Or, I\u2019d bake them, and they\u2019d come out\u2026 okay, but never truly crispy. Just kind of soft. Roasted veggies usually went in the conventional oven, and while they were good, it took longer to preheat, and they didn\u2019t get that lovely char and tenderness that the air fryer achieves so quickly. And leftovers? Microwaved pizza is just sad. This is completely different. It\u2019s faster, less messy, and the results are consistently better. My regular oven just feels\u2026 slow now, especially for smaller batches."

No more soggy fries or just \"okay\" roasted veggies. Second, the ease of use and cleanup. It\u2019s so intuitive, and it\u2019s genuinely easy to clean, which, like I said, is a huge factor for me. And third, just the versatility and how much it simplifies cooking. It\u2019s just become such a core part of my kitchen that I genuinely believe everyone should have one.

I guess\u2026 maybe if a competitor came out with something that had *significantly* more advanced smart features. Like, true integration with a really robust recipe app, or maybe some kind of self-cleaning function \u2013 though I don't know how realistic that is. Or, if it was significantly quieter while still maintaining the same performance and capacity."
