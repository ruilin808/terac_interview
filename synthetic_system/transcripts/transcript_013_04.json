      "text": "** Good afternoon, Brandon. My name is David, and I'm a product researcher with TIJN. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your feedback on our blue light blocking glasses, and we're always looking to better understand our customers' experiences."

      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** Good afternoon, David. No problem at all. Happy to help. It's not often a company actually reaches out, so that's a nice change of pace."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Absolutely. Your insights are incredibly valuable to us. We read your review, and it provided some really thoughtful points. To start, could you just tell me a little bit more about what initially prompted you to look for blue light blocking glasses? What kind of problems were you hoping they would solve?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** Well, as I mentioned in the review, I'm a retired architect, but I still do quite a bit of consulting and project work from my home office here in Fort Worth. So, I spend a significant chunk of my day, I mean, easily 9 or 10 hours, glued to a screen. CAD software, rendering programs, hopping on video calls with clients\u2026 It really takes a toll. My eyes were just constantly dry, felt tired and gritty by mid-afternoon, and I was getting these persistent, dull headaches that would just linger. I just thought, there has to be something to mitigate this."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** That sounds really disruptive to your work and daily comfort. So, given those issues, what specifically made you choose the TIJN square frames over other options you might have seen online?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** Good question. I was doing a fair bit of browsing, naturally. Honestly, a big draw was the style. You know, I'm on video calls quite a bit, and I wanted something that looked, well, professional. Not too flashy, but modern, understated. The square frames just caught my eye, they looked quite chic, as I said. And, to be frank, the price point was very appealing. I was hopeful for a budget-friendly solution. I didn't want to spend hundreds if I didn't have to, especially not knowing if they'd even work."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Understood. So, the aesthetics and the affordability were key factors in your decision. When the glasses arrived, you mentioned the packaging was minimal, and your first impression of the look was positive. But then you noted the lightness of the frame felt \"cheap.\" Could you elaborate a bit on that feeling? What would have made them feel more substantial to you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** Hmm, yeah. It's a tactile thing, isn't it? When you pick them up, they just\u2026 lack heft. The plastic felt thin, a bit brittle almost. Not like they'd stand up to much wear and tear. I'm not saying they need to be heavy, not at all, but there's a difference between lightweight and flimsy. A slightly thicker gauge of plastic, or even a different type of plastic that feels more dense, would have made a huge difference. And the hinges, they were a bit loose. They didn't really hold their position firmly when I opened them up, which again, just contributed to that overall impression of\u2026 well, corners being cut."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** That's a very clear distinction \u2013 lightweight versus flimsy. We appreciate that feedback on the perceived durability. Now, once you started using them, you highlighted the yellow tint and how it affected your architectural drawings. Could you walk me through a specific instance where this color distortion became a significant problem for your work?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** Oh, absolutely. This was probably the biggest deal-breaker for me, actually. You know, in architecture, precision in color, in shading, in material representation, it's absolutely critical. I might be reviewing a rendering of a building facade, looking at how different brick tones interact with a particular window tint, or evaluating the subtle color variations in a proposed material palette for an interior space. With the yellow tint, everything just shifted. That crisp white background on my screen became a muted cream. A cool gray suddenly had a warmer cast. It was subtle, but it was enough to make me second-guess what I was seeing. I found myself constantly taking them off to confirm colors, then putting them back on for perceived eye comfort, then taking them off again. It was just\u2026 unproductive, frustrating, and ultimately defeated the purpose of wearing them consistently. I simply couldn't wear them during any critical design review or when making final decisions on aesthetics."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** I can completely understand how that constant on-and-off would be counterproductive, especially in a field where color accuracy is paramount. So, for those critical tasks, you just stopped wearing them altogether?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** Precisely. I\u2019d wear them for, say, general email correspondence or administrative tasks, but when it came time to dive into a rendering or a detailed CAD drawing that required visual fidelity, they came right off. Which, again, sort of defeats the point of having \"blue light blocking glasses\" for *my* primary use case, which is exactly those screen-intensive design tasks."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Right. Moving on to comfort, you mentioned they were okay for short periods but became uncomfortable after about 4-5 hours. You specifically pointed to the molded plastic nose pads and the pressure behind your ears. Could you describe that discomfort a bit more? What did it feel like, and how did it impact your ability to focus?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** It wasn't excruciating pain, mind you, but it was a persistent, nagging irritation. The nose pads, they just started to feel\u2026 abrasive. Like a constant, subtle rubbing that eventually created a tender spot on the bridge of my nose. And the arms, the temples, they just exerted this gentle but steady pressure right behind my ears. Over several hours, it just built up. You know, you're trying to concentrate on a complex design problem, and in the back of your mind, you\u2019re just aware of this slight discomfort, constantly. It\u2019s distracting. And then they'd slip down my nose sometimes, too, requiring me to push them back up, which is just another little interruption. It breaks your concentration."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** It sounds like a cumulative effect, where small irritations compound over time to become quite distracting. Now, regarding the actual blue light blocking efficacy, you felt they were \"more like an Instagram filter\" than a therapeutic device. What kind of relief were you hoping for, and what did you actually experience, or perhaps *not* experience?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** (Sighs) That\u2019s the real crux of it, isn\u2019t it? I was genuinely hoping for a noticeable reduction in eye strain. I wanted to feel less gritty, less tired at the end of a long day in front of the screen. I was also hoping it might help with those headaches, and perhaps even improve my sleep, as I'd read blue light can affect melatonin production. What I got was\u2026 minimal. Marginally less eye strain, maybe? It's hard to quantify, but it certainly wasn't the \"game-changer\" I was seeking. My eyes still felt fatigued and dry by evening. The headaches persisted. And my sleep patterns, well, they remained exactly the same, as far as I could tell. It felt like a very subtle warming filter, which is fine, but it didn't deliver the tangible, functional benefits I was really investing in."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** So, the perceived benefit didn't align with the expectation, particularly concerning the core functionality. Now, looking at the positives, you still noted they looked good and were very affordable. After using them for a while and experiencing these drawbacks, how do you now perceive the value for the price?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** That's a tricky one. Initially, the price was a huge plus. Very appealing. But now, after using them, it feels\u2026 well, you get what you pay for, I suppose. They *do* look good, I'll give them that. For someone who maybe just wants a stylish accessory with a *slight* bit of blue light filtering for casual browsing for an hour or two, they might be fine. But for my intensive use, for the specific needs of my work, they didn't deliver the substance. So, in terms of *value*, that\u2019s diminished significantly for me. I\u2019d rather pay more for something that actually works and is comfortable for extended periods, even if it means sacrificing a bit on the \"budget-friendly\" aspect."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** That's really insightful, Brandon. It sounds like the initial value proposition shifted quite a bit once the practical limitations became clear. If you could design your ideal pair of blue light blocking glasses, what key improvements or features would they absolutely need to have, particularly considering your work as an architect?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** Hmm, my ideal pair\u2026 Firstly, absolutely minimal to no color distortion. That's paramount. The tint would have to be either completely clear, or so subtle it's imperceptible to the eye when looking at a screen. Secondly, comfort for extended wear. I mean, truly comfortable for 8-10 hours. That means softer, adjustable nose pads, arms that don\u2019t exert pressure, and no slipping. Thirdly, tangible efficacy. I need to *feel* a difference in eye strain and fatigue reduction. Not just a perception, but a real, noticeable relief. And finally, durability. They don\u2019t need to be heavy, but they need to feel robust, like they can withstand daily use without feeling brittle or flimsy. Perhaps a more premium material for the frame."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Those are very clear and actionable points, Brandon, thank you. No color distortion, extended comfort, tangible efficacy, and improved durability. Given your experience, if TIJN were to release an updated version addressing these issues, particularly the color distortion and comfort, would you consider purchasing from us again, or are you now looking exclusively at other brands?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** That's a tough one, David. I mean, if the improvements were genuinely significant, and there was clear evidence, say, independent reviews or very detailed product specifications that explicitly addressed those points \u2013 especially the color accuracy \u2013 then yes, I\u2019d be willing to give TIJN another shot. I appreciate the follow-up, and that shows a commitment to improving. But honestly, I'm already pretty deep into researching other options right now, looking at brands that specifically market \"clear lens\" or \"low-color-distortion\" glasses, even if they're significantly more expensive. The initial disappointment was\u2026 well, disappointing. So, you\u2019d have to really prove the improvements."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** We understand completely, and we value that honesty. It tells us where we need to focus. Finally, Brandon, if you were to rate your overall satisfaction with the TIJN Blue Light Blocking Glasses you purchased, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being extremely dissatisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied, what rating would you give?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "**Brandon",
      "text": "** Oh, um\u2026 (pauses, thinks) Considering everything we've talked about, and especially my specific professional needs, I\u2019d have to give them a\u2026 a 3. Maybe a 3.5, generously. They looked good, and they were cheap, but they really fell short on the core functionality and comfort I needed."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Thank you for that candid rating, Brandon. It's incredibly helpful for us to understand your perspective. We genuinely appreciate you taking the time to share your detailed feedback today. Your insights, particularly as someone with such a specific and demanding use case, are invaluable as we look to improve our products."
