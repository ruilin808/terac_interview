      "text": "Good morning, Janet! Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me today. My name is Mike, and I\u2019m a customer insights representative with Fitbit. We really appreciate you sharing your thoughts on the Versa 4, and we'd love to delve a little deeper into your experience. This feedback is incredibly valuable for us as we look to improve our products."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 2,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Hi Mike. No problem, happy to help. I appreciate you guys reaching out."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 3,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Wonderful. So, Janet, you\u2019ve been a loyal Fitbit user for quite a while now, going all the way back to the original Flex, which is fantastic to hear. You also mentioned in your review that the Versa 4 was a \"mixed bag\" and a bit of a \"lateral move.\" Could you elaborate a little more on what led you to that overall impression after several months of use?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Yeah, totally. Um, well, like I said, I've had Fitbits for years. I started with the Flex, then the Charge 3, and then the Versa 2, which I really liked. So, when the Versa 4 came out, I was pretty excited, you know? I figured it would be, like, the next step up, with everything just a little bit better. But honestly, it's\u2026 it's just not. It\u2019s better in some ways, but worse in others. It kinda balances out to just \"okay\" for me, which is why I gave it the 3 stars."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I understand. That makes perfect sense. Let's start with the positives you highlighted, because those are important too. You mentioned the form factor is \"sleeker and lighter,\" making it more comfortable for all-day wear. How significant is that improvement for you, especially coming from the Versa 2?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Oh, that's definitely a big one. I wear it literally all the time, even when I sleep. So, having it lighter and not, like, catching on my sleeves or feeling bulky, that's really nice. My Versa 2 wasn't *un*comfortable, but this one just kinda disappears on my wrist. It's a subtle thing, but when you wear it 24/7, it makes a difference. Like, I barely notice it\u2019s there now."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's great to hear about the comfort. You also pointed out the screen being \"noticeably brighter and more responsive,\" and the return of the physical button as being \"much more intuitive.\" Could you tell me more about how those specific changes have improved your day-to-day interaction with the watch?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Oh, for sure. The screen is a big upgrade. Sometimes with the Versa 2, especially outside or in bright light, I\u2019d have to squint to see it, or tap it a few times to get it to respond. This one is just\u2026 instant. It\u2019s a lot clearer, easier to read notifications, and swiping feels smoother. And the physical button? Thank goodness! On the Versa 3, I think it was, or maybe the Sense, they had that capacitive thing, and it was just finicky. I\u2019d press it and nothing would happen, or it would do something unexpected. Having a real button that clicks, you just *know* it\u2019s working. It feels right."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "So, it sounds like those are tangible improvements to the core user experience. And you also mentioned battery life \u2013 4-5 days is \"perfectly acceptable.\" How does that compare to what you were getting with your Versa 2, and what's your ideal battery life for a device like this?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "My Versa 2 was probably getting around 3-4 days, so the Versa 4 is a bit better, maybe an extra day, which is nice. I mean, I\u2019d *love* for it to last a week, who wouldn't? But charging it twice a week isn't a huge deal for me. I usually just pop it on the charger when I'm, like, showering or watching TV for a bit. So, 4-5 days is good enough that I don't feel like I'm constantly babysitting it, you know?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Yeah, absolutely, that balance is key. Now, shifting gears a bit to some of the frustrations you mentioned. Your biggest disappointment, and you said it seems to be a recurring theme, is the \"continued push for the Premium subscription,\" especially with the \"Daily Readiness Score\" being locked behind it. Can you elaborate on why this feels like such a significant drawback for you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Ugh, yeah, this is probably my number one gripe. Look, I\u2019ve been using Fitbit for years. I\u2019ve bought multiple devices. I\u2019ve invested in this brand. And then they keep taking features that feel like they should just be part of the watch you *buy* and put them behind a paywall. The Daily Readiness Score, it's advertised as a big feature of the Versa 4, right? And then you get it, and it's like, \"Nope, pay more money.\" It just feels\u2026 greedy, I guess? Like I'm being nickeled and dimed after already spending, what, two hundred bucks on the watch? As someone who's, you know, not working right now, every dollar counts, and it just feels like an unfair extra cost for something that should be included. I don't want another subscription bill."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I hear you, Janet. That's a very clear point, and it's something we definitely need to understand better. When you say it feels like you're \"being penalized,\" could you tell me more about that feeling? What would make you feel like you're getting full value without the Premium subscription?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Well, penalized because I bought the top-tier device. If I bought a cheaper Fitbit, maybe I'd understand, but this is supposed to be one of your flagship watches. I just expect the features that are marketed for it to *work* without me having to pay extra. It's like buying a car and then finding out you have to pay a monthly fee to use the air conditioning. It just feels\u2026 wrong. I mean, if they want to offer *extra* fancy stuff through Premium, like guided workouts or super-detailed analytics that are way beyond what the device tracks, fine. But the Readiness Score, it just feels like it's based on data the watch is *already collecting* anyway, so why can't I just see it?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's a really good analogy, and it helps clarify your perspective. Moving on to another significant point you raised: the \"removal of the Wi-Fi chip\" and the impact on music storage for Spotify or Pandora offline. You mentioned you \"used this heavily on your runs.\" Could you walk me through a typical running scenario with your Versa 2 versus now with the Versa 4? How has that change specifically affected your routine?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Oh, man, that's another huge one. So, with my Versa 2, I used to just load up my Spotify playlists onto the watch. Then, when I went for a run \u2013 I mostly run outside around my neighborhood, sometimes around the park here in Charlotte \u2013 I'd just grab my watch, put on my headphones, and go. No phone, no fuss. It was amazing. I felt so free, you know? Just me, my music, and my run. Now? I *have* to carry my phone. And it's not like I want to run with a big phone strapped to my arm or bouncing in my pocket. It completely takes away one of the main reasons I wanted a smartwatch in the first place, which was to leave my phone behind sometimes. It just feels like such a backward step. I honestly can't believe they took that feature away. What was the point of getting a \"smarter\" watch if it does *less*?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's a very clear use case where the Versa 4 is falling short of your previous experience. When you purchased the Versa 4, were you aware that this feature had been removed, or was it something you discovered after you started using it?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Honestly, I don't remember seeing it advertised anywhere that it *wouldn't* have Wi-Fi. I just assumed it would, because my Versa 2 had it! Why would they remove it? I probably didn't even look for that specific feature on the spec sheet because I just expected it to be there. It wasn\u2019t until I tried to set up my music for a run that I realized, \"Wait, where's the option?\" and then I had to go digging online to find out. Super frustrating."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I can certainly see why that would be incredibly frustrating. You also described the \"smart\" features as \"still quite basic\" and mentioned a \"lack of third-party apps and limited interaction.\" What kind of \"smart\" features or third-party apps were you hoping for, or what do you feel is missing compared to what you'd expect from a device at this price point?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Well, I mean, notifications are fine, they work. But that's pretty much it. I can't, like, quickly respond to a text with a voice command or even a full keyboard. Just a few canned responses, which aren't always what you need. And for apps\u2026 I don't know, maybe a quick weather app that's not just Fitbit's built-in one? Or something for, like, quick notes or a grocery list? I know other smartwatches, like Apple Watches, have tons of apps. I'm not expecting it to be an iPhone on my wrist, but it feels like it's barely scratching the surface of what a \"smart\" watch should be able to do. It just feels like a glorified fitness tracker with notifications, not a smartwatch."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's a good distinction \u2013 glorified fitness tracker versus a true smartwatch. It gives us a sense of your expectations for the category. And what about the syncing hiccups and GPS issues you mentioned? How frequently do those occur, and what impact do they have on your experience?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "The syncing hiccups are less frequent than with, say, my old Charge 3, but they still happen. Maybe once or twice a week it'll just take forever to sync to my phone, or I'll have to manually open the app a few times. It's not a deal-breaker, just annoying. The GPS, though, that can be a bit more annoying. Sometimes it takes a solid minute or two to lock on before I can start my run, and then sometimes, like, halfway through a run, it'll just drop the connection. Then I look at my map later and there's a big straight line where it lost signal. It throws off my pace, and it\u2019s just not accurate, you know?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I understand. That certainly impacts the reliability of your activity tracking. Given your long history with Fitbit, what initially drew you to the brand, and what kept you coming back for the Flex, Charge 3, and Versa 2? What alternatives, if any, did you consider before deciding on the Versa 4?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Hmm, good question. When I first got the Flex, it was just the thing everyone had for step counting. It was simple, easy to use. Then I moved to the Charge 3 because I wanted heart rate and more detailed sleep tracking. And the Versa 2 felt like a natural upgrade from that, getting the larger screen and the music storage, which, again, I loved. I stayed with Fitbit because, honestly, I was just used to the app, used to how it tracked everything, and all my data was there. It was comfortable. I mean, I looked at some other brands, like Garmin, and maybe Apple Watch, but Garmin felt too intense for just a casual runner like me, and Apple Watch felt\u2026 too much, and also more expensive. I just figured staying with Fitbit would be the easiest, most seamless upgrade. I guess I trusted the brand."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That \"trust\" and familiarity with the ecosystem is definitely a powerful draw. You mentioned your primary use cases are running, general activity tracking, and sleep. Are there any other daily scenarios where the Versa 4 plays a role for you? For instance, do you use it for alarms, timers, or just checking the time?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Yeah, totally. I use it for alarms every morning \u2013 I actually love the vibrating alarm, it's a gentle way to wake up without, like, startling my boyfriend. I use timers sometimes when I\u2019m cooking, and of course, for notifications. And I check the time, like, a hundred times a day. I also like seeing my steps throughout the day, just as a little motivation to get up and move, especially since I'm not working right now. I try to hit a certain step count every day. So it's definitely part of my daily routine, not just for workouts."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "And in terms of value, considering the price of the Versa 4 and your experience with it, particularly the frustrations you've highlighted, do you feel you got good value for your money?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Honestly? No, not really. With the Versa 2, I felt like I got good value. It did what I wanted it to do and more. But the Versa 4, with the music removed and the Premium stuff, it just feels like I paid more for a watch that does less of what *I* need it to do. If I had known about the music before I bought it, I probably would have just stuck with my Versa 2, or maybe looked harder at other options. For the price, it just doesn't feel \"smart\" enough, and those missing features really sting."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's very direct feedback, and it's important for us to hear. Thinking about your experience as a whole, what specific suggestions would you offer for improving the Versa 4, or future Fitbit devices, to truly make it a \"revolutionary\" upgrade for users like yourself?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Well, definitely bring back the Wi-Fi for music storage. That's non-negotiable for me. And either include the Daily Readiness Score as part of the purchase, or make Premium truly about *extra* services, not basic functionality that should be on the device. I also wish there were more third-party app options, or at least better, more interactive \"smart\" features. Like, seriously, let me respond to texts with my voice! Or just make the GPS more reliable. It feels like they focused on making it look good and feel good, but forgot about the actual functionality that made the previous models great. They need to innovate on the *smart* part, not just the physical design."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Those are very clear and actionable suggestions, Janet. Thank you. Now, given all your experiences \u2013 the good and the not-so-good \u2013 what would it take for you to consider switching to a competitor for your next wearable device? What would be the tipping point for you to leave the Fitbit ecosystem you've been loyal to for so long?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Hmm, that\u2019s a tough one because I *am* so used to Fitbit. But honestly, if my next Fitbit doesn't have music storage, or if they keep locking key features behind Premium, I\u2019m seriously going to look elsewhere. I mean, if another company offers a watch that's comfortable, tracks my fitness well, *and* lets me run phone-free with music, I\u2019d probably switch. Even if it means learning a new app and moving my data over. I'm willing to give Fitbit one more chance with my next purchase, but if they keep going this direction, I don\u2019t know if I can justify staying anymore. The music thing specifically is a big, big deal for me."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's incredibly valuable insight, Janet, especially your willingness to consider switching despite your long-term loyalty. It highlights exactly what our focus needs to be. Finally, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being \"extremely dissatisfied\" and 10 being \"extremely satisfied,\" how would you rate your overall satisfaction with your Fitbit Versa 4 today, after this conversation?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 34,
      "speaker": "Janet",
      "text": "Oh, um\u2026 I\u2019d probably stick with a 5. Maybe a 6 on a good day. It's not terrible, it does its basic job, and it's comfortable. But it didn't really impress me, and those frustrations are still there. So, yeah, I'd say a 5."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 35,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Okay, a 5. Thank you for that honest rating. Janet, I really want to thank you again for your time today and for being so candid with your feedback. Your insights into the comfort, screen, button, and especially the Premium subscription and Wi-Fi removal, are incredibly helpful for us. We truly appreciate you sharing your experience as a long-time user."
