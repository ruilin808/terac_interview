      "text": "** Hi Reese, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Emily, and I'm with the TIJN product feedback team. We really appreciate you sharing your experience with our blue light blocking glasses. Your review was incredibly detailed and positive, and we'd love to just dig a little deeper into your journey."

      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Oh, absolutely! No problem at all, Emily. Happy to help. Honestly, I'm just so thrilled with the glasses, it's the least I can do."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's fantastic to hear! And we truly value your insights. So, to start, you mentioned in your review that you were experiencing \"severe eye strain and debilitating headaches\" before finding our glasses. Could you elaborate a bit on what those symptoms felt like on a day-to-day basis, and perhaps what you might have tried to alleviate them beforehand?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Oh, gosh, yeah. \"Debilitating\" isn't an exaggeration, honestly. Uh, it was just this constant pressure right behind my eyes, like a vise was tightening around my head, almost every evening. It would start, I don't know, maybe around 3 or 4 PM, after hours of staring at my laptop for school or working on customer service calls. My eyes would just feel so... *tired*. Like they'd run a marathon. They\u2019d be red, gritty, sometimes even watery, but then also dry at the same time, if that makes sense?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** It does, absolutely. That sounds incredibly uncomfortable."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Yeah, it really was. And the headaches, they weren't just a dull ache. They'd often escalate into full-blown migraines where I'd have to just lie down in a dark room. As for what I tried... hmm. Well, I tried adjusting screen brightness, taking more frequent breaks \u2013 which is hard when you're on a deadline or have a queue of customers. I even tried those artificial tear eye drops, but they only gave like, temporary relief for the dryness, not the underlying strain or the headaches. I was really at my wit's end, you know?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** I can certainly imagine how frustrating that must have been, especially with your demanding schedule as a full-time student and working part-time. That's a lot of screen time to manage. You mentioned the price of our glasses was \"unbelievably low.\" What was your initial expectation for how much a solution like this might cost, and what made you choose TIJN over other brands you might have seen?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Right, so, my budget is pretty tight as a student, obviously. I\u2019d seen some ads for blue light glasses before, mostly on social media, and honestly, they seemed like a bit of a luxury. I figured they\u2019d be, I don't know, maybe fifty, sixty bucks *at least* for a non-prescription pair that actually looked decent. Some were even over a hundred. So when I saw the TIJN frames, and they looked so, um, *professional* and stylish in the pictures, and then I saw the price... I actually did a double-take. I was like, \"Is this real? Is it going to be super flimsy?\" But it was so affordable, I thought, \"Well, even if they're not great, it's not a huge loss.\" It was that low price combined with the style that really sealed the deal for me, given my financial situation. I didn't want to invest a lot in something that might not work."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That makes perfect sense. And you touched on the style \u2013 you found them \"sleek and premium\" for the price. Can you tell me more about what aspects of the design really stood out to you, and how they fit into your personal aesthetic?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Sure. I mean, my personal style is generally pretty understated, a bit classic but with a modern edge. The matte black finish, for one, is just... *chef's kiss*. It doesn't look like cheap plastic at all. And the square shape, I feel like it's really flattering on my face, you know? Not too big, not too small. It makes me feel, um, put-together, even when I'm just in sweats at home doing coursework. I was worried they might look too 'nerdy' in a bad way, but they actually have this, like, cool, intellectual vibe. And they're really lightweight, which was a surprise."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** You mentioned that lightness initially made you worry about durability, but you found them to be quite robust. After weeks of daily use, what gives you that confidence in their durability? Have they, perhaps, survived any accidental drops or bumps?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** *[Laughs softly]* Oh, gosh, yes. My desk setup isn't always the tidiest, especially during late-night study sessions. They've definitely, uh, slid off my keyboard a couple of times. Nothing major, thankfully, just onto the desk itself, but still. And I'm not always super gentle when I take them off and put them down. The hinges, like I said in the review, they feel solid. There's no wobbly feeling, and the frame hasn't warped or scratched easily, even with being tossed into my backpack with other things. So, yeah, that initial worry about them being flimsy because they're so light? Totally unfounded. They feel much more substantial than their weight would suggest."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's great to hear about their resilience. Now, the yellow tint is a common feature in blue light glasses, and you described it as a \"subtle, warm hue\" that you quickly adapted to. Did you notice any difference in how you perceived colors initially, and has that perception changed over time, especially for your \"color-critical tasks\"?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Oh, definitely. The first hour, everything had this sort of sepia tone, almost? Like I was watching an old movie. White backgrounds looked like... a really light cream. It was a bit jarring at first, I won't lie. I thought, \"Oh no, is this going to bother me?\" But it really did only take about an hour for my brain to adjust. Now, when I put them on, I don't even register the tint unless I consciously think about it or take them off. It's just my new normal. For the design tasks I mentioned, where I need absolute color accuracy, like when I'm reviewing a website mock-up or a presentation with specific branding colors, I *do* take them off. Because then I notice the colors are off. But that's maybe five minutes out of twelve hours of screen time, so it's a non-issue. For reading text, coding, emails \u2013 it\u2019s a blessing, it truly is."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** So it sounds like the benefits far outweigh that minor, temporary adjustment. You described the relief you felt as \"transformative\" and called the improvement in your sleep the \"biggest revelation.\" Could you elaborate on how exactly your sleep routine or quality has changed since you started using the glasses?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Oh, Emily, it's just... profound. Before, after a long day of screens, my mind would just be buzzing. Even if I was physically tired, my brain felt wired, you know? I\u2019d get into bed, and it would take me, easily, an hour to fall asleep. Sometimes more. And I'd still wake up feeling groggy, like I hadn't truly rested. Now, I wear the glasses right up until I get into bed, especially if I'm on my laptop or phone in the evening. And when I turn off the lights, it's like my brain just... *shuts down*. I drift off so much faster, probably within 15-20 minutes, maybe even less. And I wake up feeling genuinely refreshed. It\u2019s not just that I\u2019m sleeping *more*, it feels like I\u2019m sleeping *better*. It\u2019s made a huge difference to my energy levels for the next day, which is crucial for my studies."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's an incredible impact, truly a testament to the product. You also highlighted the comfort, saying you can wear them for 10-12 hours straight without any pressure points. Have you ever owned other glasses, perhaps prescription or sunglasses, that *did* cause discomfort in those long wear periods?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Oh, yeah, definitely. I used to have prescription glasses years ago, and I remember they\u2019d leave red marks on my nose after just a few hours. And if I wore sunglasses for a road trip or something, the arms would start digging in behind my ears. I\u2019d be constantly pushing them up or taking them off for a break. With these TIJN glasses, I genuinely forget I'm wearing them. They just... blend in. I think it's the combination of the lightness and the way the nose pads are designed; they don't pinch. And the arms are thin enough that they don't create pressure points, even when I'm leaning against a pillow or something. It\u2019s like they custom-fit my face, even though they\u2019re a standard size."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's a strong endorsement for their design. You mentioned you \"cannot find any significant negatives\" for these glasses. If you *had* a magic wand and could change or improve just *one* small thing about the product or the overall experience, what would that be, however minor?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** *[Pauses, thinking]* Hmm. That\u2019s a tough one, because I really am so happy. Okay, if I *had* to pick something, and this is truly minor, it would be the case they come with. It\u2019s a soft cloth pouch, which is fine for the price point, but it doesn't offer much protection if I just toss them into my backpack. I actually ended up buying a separate hard case to keep them safe, just because I value them so much now. So, maybe a slightly more robust, compact case could be an option, even if it added a couple of dollars to the price. But truly, that\u2019s me nitpicking."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's excellent feedback, Reese, and definitely something we can consider. Thank you for that. And thinking about the value again, you called them an \"absolute steal\" and an \"essential, high-value purchase.\" If you were to recommend these glasses to a peer, perhaps another student or someone in customer service, what would be the single most compelling reason you'd give them to buy these specific glasses?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Without a doubt, the relief from physical discomfort. The headaches. The eye strain. I mean, the sleep improvement is huge, but the daily, tangible relief from pain and fatigue? That's what changed everything. For someone who spends hours staring at a screen, whether it's for work or school, these glasses are like, um, an ergonomic chair for your eyes. They protect you from something you don't even realize is hurting you until it's gone. And the fact that they're stylish and comfortable and don't break the bank? That's just the icing on the cake. It makes such a difference to my ability to concentrate and actually *enjoy* my evenings instead of just recovering."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's a very powerful testimonial, Reese. It sounds like they've genuinely improved your quality of life. My final question for you today is, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being \"not at all satisfied\" and 10 being \"extremely satisfied,\" how would you rate your overall satisfaction with the TIJN blue light blocking glasses?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "**Reese",
      "text": "** Emily, honestly? It's a solid 10. Without hesitation. They've delivered on every promise and then some. I truly can't imagine going back to my screen-heavy days without them."
