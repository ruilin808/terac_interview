      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Good morning, Barbara. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Mike, and I\u2019m a representative from COSORI. We really value customer feedback, especially when an experience hasn't met expectations, and we appreciate you being willing to share yours with us directly."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 2,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Good morning, Mike. Honestly, I'm glad to talk to someone. My experience with your customer support so far has been... well, let's just say it hasn't been great."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 3,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I completely understand, Barbara, and I sincerely apologize for the frustration you've experienced. That's precisely why I wanted to reach out. We've read your review, and it\u2019s clear we fell short, both with the product and with our support. My goal today is just to listen, understand your full experience, and gather insights that can help us improve. There are no right or wrong answers, just your honest perspective. Does that sound okay?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Yes, that sounds fine. I just want to make sure my voice is actually heard this time."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Absolutely. So, to start, you mentioned in your review that you purchased the COSORI Pro II about four months ago, driven by the prospect of healthier meals and convenience. Could you tell me a bit more about what specifically motivated you to look into an air fryer at that time? What were you hoping to achieve with it?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Well, you know, I'm at an age where I'm trying to be more mindful of what I eat. And with so many recipes online, everyone just raves about air fryers. I live alone now, and cooking big meals in a regular oven for just one person feels like overkill, and honestly, it heats up my entire apartment in the summer. I wanted something quick, easy, and, yes, healthier \u2013 less oil. I saw your model, it looked sleek, good capacity, and the reviews were... well, mostly good at the time."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That makes perfect sense. So, efficiency for cooking smaller portions, healthier options, and less heat in the kitchen were key factors. Were you using a specific method before for the types of foods you intended to air fry, like fries or chicken?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Oh, absolutely. Before, it was mostly baking in the oven for things like chicken, or sometimes pan-frying. For fries, it was the oven, or, if I'm being honest, occasionally just buying pre-made stuff. The idea of getting that crispy texture without all the oil and fuss of a deep fryer was really appealing. I have a fairly compact kitchen here in New York, so a dedicated deep fryer was just out of the question space-wise."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I understand. Space is definitely a premium in the city. When you first got the Pro II and started using it, you mentioned it worked \"reasonably well\" for a few weeks, but also noted a \"stronger plastic smell than expected.\" Could you elaborate on that smell? Was it persistent, or did it eventually dissipate?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Oh, the smell. Yes. For the first few uses, maybe three or four times, it was quite strong. Like, a new plastic, chemical sort of smell. I remember thinking, \"Hmm, this isn't great, but maybe it'll burn off.\" It did eventually lessen, but honestly, it never completely went away. Every time I used it, there was always a faint smell, especially when it heated up. It always made me wonder about the quality of the materials inside, you know? Like, is this safe?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's a very valid concern, Barbara. Thank you for that detailed feedback on the odor. It's something we definitely need to investigate. You also mentioned some initial performance quirks \u2013 specifically, that the internal temperature seemed to run hotter than selected, and the digital interface was \"a bit clunky.\" Could you give me an example of the temperature issue and how you had to adjust?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Sure. Like, if a recipe said to cook something at 375 for 15 minutes, I'd often find it was browning much faster, almost to the point of burning. So, after a couple of tries, I started setting it at 350 or cutting down the time to 12 minutes, for example. It wasn't a huge deal, but it meant I couldn't just \"set it and forget it\" like I hoped. I had to babysit it a bit more. And the interface... yeah, sometimes I'd press the numbers or the start button, and it wouldn't register, so I'd have to press again, more firmly. It just felt a bit unresponsive, not as smooth as other digital displays I\u2019ve used."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "So, you adapted by making those adjustments, but it definitely added an extra layer of monitoring that detracted from the convenience you were looking for. And the interface, while functional, wasn't as intuitive as you expected. Despite these minor issues, you said you were willing to overlook them for the convenience. What *were* the moments where you felt the air fryer delivered on that convenience and met your expectations *before* it failed?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Well, when it worked, it was pretty good at what it was supposed to do. The fries, even from frozen, came out genuinely crispy, much better than in my regular oven. And chicken, boneless breasts, came out juicy inside with a nice crispy skin on the outside. For quick weeknight dinners, it was certainly faster than preheating the big oven. And cleanup, usually, was relatively easy. It did save me time, and I did feel like I was eating a bit healthier by not using as much oil. So, those initial results were promising."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's good to hear, that there were indeed positive outcomes when it was functional. Then, of course, the major issue arose. You described it as failing \"spectacularly\" \u2013 suddenly powering off in the middle of cooking. Can you recall what you were cooking exactly, or any other details about that moment? Was there any unusual sound or smell right before it died?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Oh, gosh, yes. I was just air frying some mixed vegetables \u2013 bell peppers, zucchini, onions, you know, pretty standard stuff. I think it had been on for about ten minutes. There wasn't any strange smell or sound, no loud pop or anything dramatic. It just... went silent. The screen went black, everything. One moment it was working, the next, dead. I remember just staring at it, thinking, \"Did I accidentally unplug it?\" But no, it was plugged in."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "And you tried unplugging, waiting, trying different outlets, but nothing brought it back to life?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Exactly. I tried it in two different outlets in the kitchen, and then even took it to another room to try a third, just to rule out my own wiring. Nothing. No light, no display, no fan, no heat. Completely unresponsive. It felt very final."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's incredibly frustrating, especially after such a short period of ownership. And given your light usage \u2013 only twice a week \u2013 that certainly points to a significant reliability concern on our end. After it failed, you mentioned your experience with our customer support was \"abysmal.\" Could you walk me through what happened when you tried to get help?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Oh, where do I even begin? First, finding the right contact on your website was a maze. Eventually, I found a contact form and filled out all the details, explaining exactly what happened, how it just died, how I tried troubleshooting. Then, I waited. And waited. Finally, I got a response, and it was a canned email asking me to perform all the troubleshooting steps I had *already* explicitly stated I had done. Unplug it, plug it back in, try a different outlet. It was like they hadn't even read my initial message."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I apologize for that, Barbara. It sounds like our initial automated system or response didn't effectively triage your issue."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "No, it didn't. Then, when I finally got to speak to an actual person, after explaining *everything* again, they put me through the same script. I kept saying, \"It's completely dead, there's no power at all,\" but they just kept going through their checklist. It was infuriating. And *then*, the kicker: they told me I would need to ship the entire unit back to them for inspection, *at my own cost*. For a product that failed after four months of light use? I paid good money for this. I expected better. That's when I truly felt like it was a complete waste of my money and time."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I can absolutely see why that would be outrageous. Shipping a large appliance, especially when it's failed so quickly, and being asked to bear that cost, is certainly not the customer experience we want to provide. What was your expectation around warranty and support when you purchased the appliance?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "My expectation was that if a product, especially an appliance that's supposed to be durable, fails within a few months, the company stands behind it. That means a prompt replacement, or at least a free return shipping label for inspection. Not making *me* jump through hoops and pay more money. For a company to not have a more robust warranty or support process for such a glaring defect, it just tells me they don't have faith in their own product's quality."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Your perspective on that is extremely valuable, Barbara. It's clear that the process added significant insult to injury. Considering all this, what would it take for you to feel like you received good value for your money, even if the original unit failed? What would a company with \"a proven track record for durability and customer care,\" as you put it, do differently in your eyes?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "For value? First, the product needs to work reliably for a reasonable lifespan \u2013 certainly more than four months! And when it doesn't, the support needs to be seamless. That means acknowledging the problem quickly, not making me repeat myself, and offering a fair solution without additional cost or hassle to the customer. For a reputable brand, I'd expect them to immediately offer to send a replacement unit and provide a prepaid shipping label for the faulty one, or even just say, \"Don't bother shipping it back, we'll send a new one.\" My time is valuable, Mike. Having to pack up a dead appliance, take it to a shipping center, pay for it, then wait... it's just too much for a brand-new item."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "I hear you loud and clear, Barbara. The value isn't just in the initial price, but in the total ownership experience, including reliability and post-purchase support. If we were able to address these issues \u2013 both the product's durability and our customer service process \u2013 what specific improvements to the air fryer itself, besides just working reliably, would make it a truly excellent product for you? Thinking back to the plastic smell, the temperature calibration, or the digital interface."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Hmm, well, definitely fix that plastic smell. That was off-putting from day one. And the temperature accuracy, that's important. It's frustrating to constantly guess and adjust. A consistent, accurate temperature is fundamental. And the digital interface, make it more responsive, more intuitive. Maybe even a little clearer, with bigger numbers or bolder icons. I'm 50, my eyes aren't what they used to be, you know? But honestly, Mike, reliability is number one. If it doesn't work, nothing else matters."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Thank you for those specific points. Clearer, more responsive controls and accurate temperature are definitely actionable feedback. What about the capacity of the 5.8QT? For cooking for yourself, was that generally a good size, or did you ever wish for something bigger or smaller?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "For just me, it was actually a good size. It was big enough to do a decent portion of vegetables or a couple of chicken breasts, but not so huge it took over my limited counter space. That aspect, the footprint and capacity, I thought was well-designed. If it had worked, it would have been perfect for my needs in that regard."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. You mentioned in your review that you would \"strongly advise anyone considering the COSORI Pro II to look elsewhere.\" What would have to change for you to reconsider that recommendation, or even consider another COSORI product in the future?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "That's a tough one, Mike. It would take a significant commitment from your company. I'd need to see that you've truly addressed the quality control issues, which means no more plastic smells, accurate temperatures, and units that last. And, more importantly for me now, a complete overhaul of your customer service, especially for warranty claims. I'd need to trust that if something went wrong again, I wouldn't be put through that same terrible experience. Honestly, at this point, it would probably take a *personal* recommendation from someone I really trust, who had a flawless experience with a *newer* model and their support, for me to even look your way again. I'm pretty wary now."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "That's completely fair, Barbara. Trust is earned, and it sounds like we\u2019ve severely eroded yours. This feedback is critical for us to understand the depth of the issue. Just one last question for today. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is extremely dissatisfied and 10 is extremely satisfied, how would you rate your overall satisfaction with your COSORI Pro II experience, including the product and the support?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 34,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "Oh, wow. A 1 to 10 scale? Given everything, the failure, the abysmal support, the waste of my money and time... I have to say, it's a 1. I couldn't be more dissatisfied. It was a complete letdown."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 35,
      "speaker": "Mike",
      "text": "Thank you for your honesty, Barbara. A '1' clearly indicates the severity of your experience, and we take that very seriously. I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to share all of this with me today. Your detailed feedback on everything from the initial plastic smell to the customer service process is invaluable. Please know that I will be sharing all of your insights directly with our product development and customer service teams. While I can't resolve your specific issue directly on this call, I want you to know that your voice is heard, and we are committed to using this feedback to improve. Thank you again, Barbara."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 36,
      "speaker": "Barbara",
      "text": "You're welcome, Mike. I hope it helps."
