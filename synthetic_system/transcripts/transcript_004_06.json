      "text": "** Good morning, Anthony. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is David, and I'm with Cosori. We really appreciate you sharing your feedback with us online, and we'd love to dive a little deeper into your experience with the Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo. This is purely for product improvement, and your insights are incredibly valuable."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Hey David, no problem at all. Happy to help. You know, I spend a lot of time talking to customers myself in my job, so I get it. Good feedback is important."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Exactly. So, Anthony, to start, you mentioned in your review that you were upgrading from a smaller, entry-level air fryer. Could you tell me a bit more about what prompted that initial purchase decision for the Pro II? What were you hoping for, specifically, that your old one wasn't delivering?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Yeah, sure. My old one, it was just\u2026 *small*. Like, really small. I'd bought it a couple years back, on a whim, you know? Just wanted to try the air fryer thing. It worked fine for a single chicken breast or a handful of fries, but if I wanted to do, say, a decent batch of wings for when my daughter came over, or cook a couple of pork chops at once, forget about it. Everything was just too cramped. So, the main thing was capacity. I needed something bigger. And when I saw \"Pro II,\" I figured, \"Okay, this isn't just bigger, it's gotta be, like, better, right? More advanced.\" That was the hope."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** So, capacity was definitely a key driver. And you felt the \"Pro II\" designation implied a leap in technology or features?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Absolutely. I mean, \"Pro II.\" It just sounds like it's a step up, you know? Not just from my dinky old one, but from the standard models out there. I was looking for something that felt more substantial, more capable. My buddy actually has one of those smart ovens, and I kinda thought, \"Hey, maybe this air fryer will have some of that smart tech, but in a smaller package.\""
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** That's really helpful context. And how has the 5.8-quart capacity specifically met your needs? Can you give me an example of something you can now cook that you couldn't before, or just more easily?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Oh, the capacity is definitely good. No complaints there. I can finally do a decent amount of wings \u2013 not a huge party batch, but enough for me and my daughter, without having to do three separate rounds. Or, you know, if I cut up a rack of ribs into three sections, they fit. Before, with my old one, I'd have to stack stuff, and then nothing would cook right. So yeah, capacity-wise, that's a win. Big improvement for sure."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** That's great to hear. You also noted that when it works well, it produces some really good results \u2013 crispy fries, chicken tenders, roasted vegetables. Can you elaborate on what you mean by \"when it works well\"? What are those ideal conditions, or what prevents it from always achieving those results?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** *[Sighs slightly]* Yeah, that's the rub, isn't it? \"When it works well.\" See, when I'm cooking a smaller batch, or if I'm really, really diligent about shaking the basket and turning things over constantly, it's fantastic. Fries are golden, chicken is crispy. But as soon as I load it up closer to its capacity, say, a fuller basket of fries or more chicken pieces, that's when it gets tricky. I'll pull it out, and one side of the basket, or certain pieces, will be perfectly done, maybe even a little overdone, while others are still kinda soft or undercooked. It's like there are hot spots in there, you know?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Hot spots. So, it's more noticeable with larger batches then? And what kind of manual intervention are you typically having to do to compensate for that?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Exactly. Larger batches. I'm shaking the basket way more often than I'd like \u2013 every five minutes sometimes \u2013 and even then, I find myself pulling out half the batch that's done, then putting the rest back in for a few more minutes. It just adds a lot of extra time and fuss to what's supposed to be a convenient appliance. It kinda defeats the purpose of \"set it and forget it.\" My old, cheap one was more consistent in that regard, just smaller."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** That's certainly not the experience we want our customers to have, especially with a model we call \"Pro II.\" You mentioned the digital interface is easy enough to navigate and the presets are a decent starting point. Are there any particular presets you find yourself using most often, and what kind of tweaks are you typically making?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** The presets are, uh, okay. I mostly use the one for fries, or chicken. But I almost always have to adjust the time, or the temperature, or both. For fries, the preset usually isn't long enough to get them truly crispy, especially if it's a fuller basket. Chicken, sometimes it's too high a temperature and it dries out before the inside is done. So, I've learned to just add a few minutes, or drop the temp a bit and cook longer. It's not a huge deal, but again, for a \"Pro II,\" I expected them to be a bit more dialed in, you know?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Understood. And the cleaning, you said the non-stick coating makes it straightforward. How often are you finding yourself cleaning it, and have you encountered any specific challenges with that aspect?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Cleaning is pretty good, actually. That's one of the definite positives. I usually wipe it down after every use, or give the basket a quick wash. The non-stick holds up, and food doesn't usually get baked on. So, that part's a breeze. No complaints there."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Good to hear. Now, let's talk about some of the areas where it fell short of your expectations. The lack of smart connectivity was a significant point for you, especially given the \"Pro II\" name. What specific smart features were you expecting or hoping for?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Right, the smart features. That was a big one. I was expecting, at minimum, some kind of app control. To preheat it from my phone while I'm on the couch, or check the remaining time without having to get up. My neighbor has a different brand, and his has recipe integration, where it tells you exactly what to do and even sets the time and temp for you. That would have been amazing. For something called \"Pro II,\" it felt like a real oversight that it was missing all of that. It just felt\u2026 basic, in that department, despite the name. Like they just slapped \"Pro II\" on it without actually adding the features to back it up."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** I can certainly see why that would be disappointing when you're anticipating an upgrade with that kind of branding. You also mentioned the noise level being noticeably louder than your previous air fryer, and potentially disruptive in an open-plan living space. Could you describe how loud it gets and how that impacts your household?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** It's not like, jet engine loud, but it's a persistent, high-pitched hum. My old one was a whisper compared to this. I live in a fairly small apartment, you know, open-plan living room/kitchen. So when this thing is running, it's *running*. If I'm trying to watch TV, I have to turn the volume up. If I'm on a call for work, or talking to someone in the living room, it's just this constant background noise that's hard to ignore. It's definitely something I notice, and honestly, sometimes it makes me think twice about using it if it's late or I'm trying to relax."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** That's a very practical concern, especially in a New York apartment. And on the topic of build quality, you noted the plastic housing felt less robust and raised concerns about long-term durability. Can you elaborate on what specifically made you feel that way?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Yeah, it's just the general feel of it. When you touch it, it feels a bit lightweight, plasticky. My old one, cheap as it was, felt a bit more solid. When I open and close the drawer on the Cosori, it's not a super smooth glide, and the plastic on the outside just feels\u2026 less substantial. I just worry about how it's going to hold up over a few years of daily use. Will the plastic crack? Will the drawer mechanism hold? For the price, and with that \"Pro II\" label, I was expecting something that felt a bit more premium, a bit more like a tank, you know? Something that inspires confidence it'll last."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** I understand completely. Given everything we've discussed \u2013 the good capacity, the cleaning, but also the consistency issues, the lack of smart features, the noise, and the build quality \u2013 how would you describe your overall price-to-value perception of the COSORI Pro II? Did it feel like a worthwhile investment for what you paid?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Uh, honestly? Not entirely. I mean, it *does* cook. And the capacity is a big plus. But for what I shelled out for it, I expected more. I expected consistency in cooking, I expected some of those \"Pro\" features like app connectivity, and I expected it to feel like a more solid piece of equipment. Instead, I feel like I paid for the extra capacity, and that's about it. The \"Pro II\" part of the name just feels like a marketing gimmick rather than an actual reflection of advanced features or superior performance. So, no, not really a worthwhile investment for the *price*."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** That\u2019s very candid, and we appreciate it. If you were talking to a friend or colleague who was looking for a new air fryer, what would be your honest recommendation, and why? Would you recommend the Pro II, or suggest they look at alternatives?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Well, it depends on what they're looking for, I guess. If they just want capacity, and they don't care about noise or smart features, and they're willing to shake things a lot, then yeah, it *works*. But if they're like me, hoping for an actual \"upgrade\" in terms of technology and consistent cooking, I'd tell them to hold off on this specific model. I'd tell them to really look at what other brands are offering in that \"Pro\" category, especially for the smart stuff and quieter operation. Or maybe just stick with a cheaper, simpler model if all they want is basic air frying."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** That\u2019s very clear advice. If Cosori were to release a true \"Pro III\" model, what would be the absolute non-negotiable features or improvements that would make you consider buying it again, and perhaps even switch from a competitor if you had already moved on?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** Okay, so a \"Pro III,\" huh? First off, it *has* to be consistent. No more hot spots, even with a fuller basket. That's paramount. Second, it absolutely needs smart connectivity \u2013 app control, remote monitoring, recipe integration, the works. That's what \"Pro\" means to me in today's world. Third, it needs to be significantly quieter. I don't want to have to crank my TV up. And finally, the build quality. I need it to feel substantial, durable, like it's going to last me five, six, seven years without me worrying about it. If it had all that, and the price was fair, then yeah, I'd definitely give Cosori another shot. I like the *idea* of Cosori, but this one just didn't hit the mark."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** Anthony, this has been incredibly insightful. Your feedback on consistency, smart features, noise, and build quality, especially in relation to the \"Pro II\" branding and price point, is exactly what we need to hear. Before we wrap up, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being extremely dissatisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied, what would be your overall satisfaction rating for the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "**Anthony",
      "text": "** *[Pauses, thinking]* Hmm. Okay, so it does what it says it does in terms of basic air frying and capacity. It\u2019s not terrible. But it definitely disappointed on the \"Pro II\" promise. I'd say\u2026 a 6. It\u2019s a functional appliance, but not the upgrade I was really hoping for, especially for the money."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "**David",
      "text": "** A 6. Thank you, Anthony. That's very clear. We truly appreciate your honesty and your time today. Your feedback gives us a lot to consider as we continue to improve our products. Thanks again for being a Cosori customer."
