      "text": "** Hi Tatum, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Emily, and I'm with the customer experience team here at COSORI. We really appreciate you sharing your feedback, especially through your recent online review. It's incredibly valuable for us to understand our customers' real-world experiences, and we want to dig a little deeper into what you've shared."

      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Of course, Emily. Happy to help. I appreciate you reaching out. I, uh, I was pretty candid in my review, so I hope it's useful."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** It absolutely is, Tatum. Every bit of feedback, positive or negative, helps us improve. First, could you just confirm your understanding that this call is being recorded for quality assurance purposes?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Yes, that's fine. Confirmed."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** Wonderful, thank you. So, Tatum, in your review, you mentioned purchasing the COSORI Pro II about six months ago. Before we get into the specifics of your experience, I'm curious: what initially led you to choose the COSORI Pro II specifically? Were there other brands or models you were considering at the time?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Hmm, let me think. Yes, I was looking for an air fryer for a while. My partner and I, we've got one kid, so a family of three, and we were trying to eat a bit healthier, you know, cut down on oil. I'd heard a lot about air fryers. I looked at a few different brands, like Philips and Ninja, but the COSORI Pro II, uh, it really seemed to hit the sweet spot for capacity \u2013 the 5.8QT was perfect for us. And honestly, the reviews I saw online, before I bought it, they were overwhelmingly positive about its performance and how easy it was to use. The digital controls looked straightforward, and the price point felt reasonable for what it promised."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That makes a lot of sense, especially the emphasis on capacity and ease of use for a small family. You mentioned wanting to eat healthier. How often did you envision using the air fryer when you bought it, and how does that compare to how frequently you actually *have* used it?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Well, I imagined it would be a bit of a workhorse, honestly. I was hoping for almost daily use, or at least several times a week. We cook dinner pretty much every night, and sometimes lunch leftovers. Initially, it was pretty close to that expectation. For the first few months, we were using it three, maybe four times a week. It was fantastic for quick meals after work. But, um, as the problems started, that frequency has definitely dropped. Now it's more like once a week, if that. It's just not as reliable as I need it to be, so I often default back to the oven or stovetop."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's a significant drop in usage, which clearly points to your frustration. You mentioned \"as the problems started.\" In your review, you highlighted the non-stick coating flaking off as a major concern. Could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this, and what your care routine was for the crisper plate?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Yeah, the coating. That was, um, probably the first really disappointing thing. It started around the three-month mark. So, I bought it in, let's see, February? So, by May, early June, I started seeing little specks. And I was so careful! I always hand-washed it, never put it in the dishwasher. I used a soft sponge, never abrasive cleaners or anything harsh. That was a big selling point for me, the easy cleanup, and I followed the instructions religiously. But it just started flaking off, little by little, especially around the edges of the plate. It's concerning, you know, ingesting that stuff."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** Absolutely, Tatum, we completely understand your concern about food safety. It's not the experience we want our customers to have, especially when following care instructions. You also brought up the inconsistent heating, where food would be burnt on one side and undercooked on the other. Can you recall if this issue started around the same time as the flaking, or did it develop later?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** I think it might have been a little bit after the coating issue, maybe closer to four months in. It was a gradual thing, not like it just suddenly stopped working. At first, I thought maybe I was overloading it, or not shaking the basket enough. But then, even with small batches, or when I was really diligent about shaking and flipping, I'd still get, um, like you said, burnt spots on chicken tenders and fries that were simultaneously limp and charred. My chicken, it's the worst. It'll be completely dry on the outside, and then still pink in the middle. It's just a constant guessing game."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That sounds incredibly frustrating, Tatum. It completely defeats the purpose of the convenience an air fryer is supposed to offer. When you say you have to constantly monitor the food, how does that impact your cooking process? Are you having to adjust cooking times significantly, or even temperatures?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Oh, yeah, absolutely. I barely trust the timer anymore. I used to just set it and walk away, but now I'm constantly hovering, pulling out the basket, shaking it, checking with a thermometer, flipping things over. Sometimes I'll even rotate the food in the basket to try and get more even exposure. And the cooking times, forget it. If a recipe says 15 minutes, I'm checking at 10, then 12, then 15, and still, it's a toss-up. It adds so much time and stress to what should be a simple cooking method. It's like I'm back to square one, trying to figure out how to cook things all over again."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** I really hear you on that, Tatum. It sounds like it's taken away a lot of the initial benefit you were seeking. You also mentioned in your review that the machine produces a significant amount of noise and that it seems to have gotten louder over time. Can you describe the kind of noise it makes? Is it a hum, a rattle, or something else?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Hmm, it's not really a rattle, more like a very loud, high-pitched whirring sound. It's the fan, I assume. Initially, it was a tolerable hum, like any appliance, but now it's much louder. It\u2019s gotten to the point where if I'm trying to have a conversation in the kitchen or even watch TV in the living room, which isn't far, it's quite disruptive. It feels like the whole unit is vibrating more, or the fan is just, uh, struggling more than it used to. It's just another indicator that the build quality isn't quite what I expected."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's really helpful to understand. So, the noise, the flaking, the inconsistent heating \u2013 these collectively have impacted your perception of the overall build quality. You mentioned it initially seemed decent, but now feels flimsy. Are there any other elements or parts of the machine that contribute to that feeling of flimsiness, beyond the coating?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Well, just the general feel of the basket, I suppose. It feels a bit lighter, less substantial than I thought it would for the price. And the way it slides in and out, it's not as smooth as it used to be. It just doesn't inspire confidence when you handle it. It's like the whole thing is just... tired. For a product that was supposed to be a \"workhorse,\" as I said, it hasn't really held up."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** I understand. You're looking for a robust, reliable appliance that can withstand regular use. Given these issues, Tatum, how has this experience affected your overall perception of value for money? When you bought it, you mentioned the price felt reasonable. How do you feel about the investment now?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Honestly? I regret it. For the price I paid, I definitely expected more than six months of adequate performance. It was a couple of hundred dollars, which for us, it's not a small amount. I save up for these kinds of purchases. I expected it to last for years, like a reliable oven or a good microwave. Instead, it feels like I've got a glorified, noisy, unpredictable oven that I paid a premium for. The value proposition just isn't there anymore. It's become a source of frustration, not convenience."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** I hear your disappointment loud and clear, Tatum. You also mentioned reaching out to customer support regarding the flaking. Could you walk me through that experience a little more? What was the resolution process like, and where does that stand currently?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Oh, that's been\u2026 a process. I reached out a few weeks ago. They were polite, as I said, but it felt very by-the-book. I had to send multiple photos of the flaking, which I did. Then I had to dig up my proof of purchase, which was a digital receipt, thankfully. But then it was a lot of waiting. I followed up, and they said they were \"reviewing the case.\" I think I've sent about three follow-up emails now. I'm still waiting on a satisfactory solution. What would be satisfactory? Well, ideally, a replacement unit that actually works as advertised and *lasts*. Or a full refund, honestly, at this point. It's just drawn out, and it makes me feel like they're not really prioritizing getting this resolved quickly."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** Thank you for sharing those details, Tatum. We definitely want to ensure our support process is as smooth and efficient as possible, so that feedback is crucial. If you could suggest one major improvement to the COSORI Pro II, based on your experience, what would it be?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Just one? That's tough. But I think it boils down to quality control. Specifically, the durability of that non-stick coating. That's a deal-breaker for me. If that could be genuinely robust, actually non-stick and safe, even after daily use and careful washing, that would be huge. And then, tied to that, the heating element and fan \u2013 they need to be consistent. It's about fundamental reliability. If the core functions aren't there, then all the bells and whistles don't matter."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** Those are very clear and actionable suggestions, Tatum. It sounds like fundamental reliability and consistency are paramount for you. Looking ahead, if you were in the market for a new air fryer today, what would make you consider another COSORI product, or alternatively, what would definitely push you to switch to a competitor?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Honestly, at this point, it would take a pretty significant re-evaluation of the brand. I'd need to see clear evidence of major improvements in material quality and heating consistency. Maybe an extended warranty specifically covering the coating, or really stellar, proactive customer service that shows they stand behind their product. Otherwise, I'd probably just go back to looking at Ninja or Philips, maybe even Instant Pot. I'd prioritize reviews that talk about longevity and consistent performance over anything else. I need a product that I can trust to just *work* without becoming a project."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's fair, and we appreciate your candidness. Just a couple more questions, Tatum. Thinking back to any positive aspects you initially experienced \u2013 were there any specific foods or dishes that the air fryer excelled at before the issues started, or even now, if you're very careful?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Well, yeah. The first month or two, it did make really good fries. Like, surprisingly crispy without all the oil. And chicken tenders, they were great too. Even some frozen vegetables, like Brussels sprouts, were really good. So, the *potential* was there, you know? That's why the disappointment is so keen, because I know what it *could* do. It\u2019s just that it became so unreliable. And the convenience, initially, of not having to preheat a big oven for a small batch of food was a huge time-saver. That was definitely a plus."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** That's great to hear about the initial positive experiences, and it highlights how frustrating it must be when that consistency fades. So, finally, Tatum, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being extremely dissatisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied, what would your overall satisfaction with your COSORI Pro II Air Fryer be right now?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Right now? Given everything we've talked about, the flaking, the uneven cooking, the noise, the slow customer support, I'd have to say, um, a 2. Maybe a 2.5, just because those first few weeks were okay. But yeah, definitely leaning towards the lower end. It's just not what I invested in."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 34,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** Thank you, Tatum. That 2.5 rating, along with all the detailed feedback you've provided, is incredibly important for us. We genuinely appreciate you taking the time to share your honest experience today. This conversation will be instrumental in helping our product development and quality assurance teams understand areas where we need to focus our improvements. We\u2019ll be in touch regarding your ongoing customer support case."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 35,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** Okay, thank you, Emily. I appreciate you listening. I hope this helps."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 36,
      "speaker": "**Emily",
      "text": "** It absolutely does, Tatum. Thanks again for your time. Have a good rest of your day."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 37,
      "speaker": "**Tatum",
      "text": "** You too. Bye."
