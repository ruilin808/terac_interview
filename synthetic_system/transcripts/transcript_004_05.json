      "text": "Good morning, Edward, and thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Sarah, and I\u2019m a representative from COSORI. We really appreciate you sharing your feedback on your Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo. We value our customers' experiences, and your insights are crucial for us to understand how we can improve."
    },

      "turnId": 2,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Good morning, Sarah. Happy to help. I figure if I\u2019m going to write a review, I should be willing to discuss it too, right? Hopefully, it\u2019s useful."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 3,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Absolutely, it is. We read your review with great interest. To start, could you tell me a bit more about what prompted you to purchase the COSORI Pro II? You mentioned upgrading from an older, smaller air fryer. What were you specifically looking for in that upgrade?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Well, primarily, as I said, capacity was a big one. My old one, bless its heart, was just too small. Cooking even for just my wife and me, let alone when the grandkids visit, meant multiple batches for just about anything. It was a chore. So, more capacity was non-negotiable. I also hoped for better, more consistent cooking, and, frankly, something a bit more modern. I'm a retired product manager, Sarah, so I tend to look at these things rather critically \u2013 I expected some innovation, given the \"Pro II\" designation."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That makes perfect sense, Edward. So, capacity and improved performance were key drivers. And when you say \"more modern\" or \"innovation,\" what kind of features or advancements were you imagining for a \"Pro II\" model?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Hmm, good question. Not necessarily a kitchen full of gadgets, mind you. I'm 71, so I'm not chasing every bleeding-edge smart feature. But I *do* appreciate intelligent design. I was thinking something like perhaps more precise temperature control that genuinely adapts, or maybe even some subtle app integration that isn't just a gimmick \u2013 like a notification when cooking is done, or perhaps pre-set recipes that truly optimize the cooking process based on the food type and quantity. Or even just a more robust internal sensor system. Something that elevated it beyond simply being a larger version of a basic model. Does that make sense?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "It does, Edward, perfectly. You're looking for meaningful innovation that enhances the core cooking experience, not just adding features for the sake of it."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Exactly. Efficiency and effectiveness. That\u2019s always been my mantra."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Speaking of the core cooking experience, you mentioned in your review that the 5.8QT capacity has been a definite step up and is the main reason you keep it. Can you elaborate on the types of meals or scenarios where that larger capacity truly shines for you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Oh, definitely. Chicken wings, for example. My wife loves them, and with the old one, I'd have to do two or three rounds to get enough for a meal. Now, I can comfortably fit a decent batch. Same with frozen items like those thick-cut fries or a bag of onion rings; it just cooks them all at once. And when the grandkids are over \u2013 which is usually four of us, maybe five \u2013 being able to quickly whip up a larger portion of something crispy without feeling like I'm running a small diner is, well, it\u2019s a relief. It really does cut down on the effort for those larger batches."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That's great to hear that it's delivering on that primary need. And you also mentioned that when it cooks well, the food comes out perfectly crispy and golden, particularly with frozen items. Are there any specific types of food where you feel the COSORI Pro II truly excels?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Yes, frozen foods, as I said. Things that are pre-battered or par-fried, like frozen spring rolls, chicken nuggets for the kids, or fish sticks. Those tend to come out exceptionally well \u2013 crispy on the outside, hot on the inside. Almost like they\u2019ve been deep-fried but without the mess and oil. Fresh vegetables, too, like broccoli or Brussels sprouts, get a nice char on them. It\u2019s quite good for those."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Excellent. Now, let's talk about some of the aspects that you felt prevented you from being enthusiastic. You brought up the \"Pro II\" branding feeling misleading. Beyond the lack of \"smart\" features you just described, was there anything else that contributed to that feeling?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Well, yes. It felt like a missed opportunity. For a \"Pro\" model, I expected a certain level of, shall we say, *refinement*. Not just in features, but in performance and even build. It\u2019s like buying a car that says \"Sports Edition\" but then it drives just like the base model, just with bigger wheels. The digital interface is fine, straightforward enough, but it\u2019s not *intuitive* in a way that suggests advanced engineering. It's just a standard digital interface. No smart diagnostics, no advanced cooking modes, nothing that really differentiates it in a meaningful way from, say, a standard digital air fryer. It just feels... *standard*."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I understand. You were anticipating a more noticeable leap in engineering and user experience that justified the \"Pro II\" designation. You also mentioned heating consistency issues, especially with larger batches. Can you tell me more about that? What were you cooking, and what did you observe?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Yes, this is a real one. Let me think... I was making a larger batch of homemade potato fries once, and even with diligent shaking and rotating the basket every few minutes, some fries came out beautifully golden and crisp, and others were still a bit pale and soft. Another time, I was trying to cook some chicken drumsticks, and I found that the ones closer to the sides or bottom were more done, almost to the point of being a little dry, while the ones in the center needed a bit more time. It just seems like there are hotspots, and the airflow isn't as consistent across the entire cooking area as I had hoped, especially when the basket is fuller. It\u2019s not terrible, as I said, but it means I have to babysit it more than I\u2019d like, which defeats some of the convenience."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That's really helpful detail, Edward, thank you. Uneven cooking, especially with larger batches, sounds frustrating when you're trying to save time. And you also mentioned the fan noise and the overall build quality feeling less than premium. Could you expand on those points?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "The fan noise\u2026 it\u2019s just loud. It\u2019s not a soft hum; it\u2019s a distinct whirring sound. It\u2019s noticeable, even from another room. My old, smaller air fryer, which was years older, wasn\u2019t this loud. It just makes its presence known, if you know what I mean. As for the build quality, it\u2019s sturdy enough, I suppose. It doesn\u2019t feel flimsy. But when you look closely, the plastic housing just feels like standard appliance plastic. It lacks that... *heft* or *finish* that would suggest \"premium\" or \"Pro.\" And the basket, it occasionally catches when I slide it in and out. It\u2019s not a major fault, but it\u2019s a minor annoyance that accumulates, you know? It\u2019s not a smooth, satisfying glide every time. Little things like that add up."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "They absolutely do. It sounds like those small friction points detract from the overall user experience you expect from a \"Pro\" model. Thinking about your experience as a product manager, if you were to offer specific suggestions for improvement based on these points, what would be at the top of your list for the next iteration of the Pro II?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Oh, a few things, Sarah. Firstly, address the heating consistency. Maybe a different fan design, or internal geometry to ensure truly even airflow throughout the entire basket, regardless of how full it is. That\u2019s fundamental. Secondly, the noise. Can it be quieter? Even a slight reduction would make a difference. And thirdly, if you're going to call it \"Pro II,\" then it needs a genuine differentiator beyond just size. Whether that\u2019s smarter, more adaptive heating algorithms, or a material upgrade that feels more substantial and durable. And, um, the basket mechanism, make it smoother. It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s part of the everyday interaction."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Those are very clear and actionable suggestions, Edward. We really appreciate you laying them out. You mentioned the price point earlier and that you expected more innovation for it. How do you feel about the overall value for money now, after several months of use?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "It\u2019s... average. For what it is, a larger, functional air fryer, the price is acceptable. But if you consider the \"Pro II\" branding and the implied premium, then it feels a bit overpriced for what it actually delivers. I paid what I thought was a premium for an *experience* and *performance* that was a significant step up, and it didn't quite hit that mark. It\u2019s a satisfactory purchase because it solved my capacity problem, but I wouldn't call it excellent value if you factor in the expectations set by the naming and the cost."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I see. So, the value perception is tied heavily to the unmet expectations around the \"Pro II\" designation. Given everything we've discussed, Edward, from its capacity benefits to the areas you feel could be improved, how likely are you to recommend the COSORI Pro II Air Fryer to a friend or colleague, let's say on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all likely and 10 is extremely likely?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "Hmm, that\u2019s a good question. Let me think about that. If someone specifically said they needed a larger air fryer for frozen foods or batch cooking and didn't care about smart features or absolute perfection, I\u2019d probably say, \"Yeah, it does the job, but don't expect the world.\" So, um, maybe a 6. A solid 6. It\u2019s functional, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019d rave about. I wouldn't discourage someone from buying it, but I\u2019d certainly temper their expectations based on my experience."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "A 6, that's very clear. And finally, Edward, what would it take for you to consider switching to a competitor's air fryer in the future? What would that competitor's product need to offer that the current COSORI Pro II doesn't?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "That\u2019s where the \"Pro\" aspect comes in, Sarah. A competitor would need to offer genuinely consistent heating across the entire cooking area, especially for larger loads. Quieter operation. And, crucially, a demonstrably superior user experience \u2013 whether that's through intelligent programming, truly robust build quality that feels premium to the touch, or even just a more thoughtfully designed basket system that glides perfectly every single time. If another brand could offer that level of polished performance and innovative thought, particularly in the \"Pro\" category, I would absolutely consider making a switch. I\u2019m always looking for the best tool for the job."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Thank you, Edward. That's incredibly valuable feedback. It truly helps us understand not just where we can improve, but also what the market is looking for in a premium air fryer experience. Your insights from a product manager's perspective are particularly enlightening. We genuinely appreciate your honesty and time today. Is there anything else you'd like to add or any other feedback you feel is important for us to know?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "Edward",
      "text": "No, I think we've covered it pretty thoroughly, Sarah. I hope this helps you folks make a better product in the future. I believe in giving constructive feedback."
