      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** Hi Cameron, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Mike, and I\u2019m a representative from TruSkin. We really appreciate you agreeing to this call; your feedback is incredibly important to us, especially after reading your review."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Hey Mike. Yeah, no problem. I mean, I put a lot of detail into that review, so I guess I'm happy to elaborate if it actually helps, you know?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** It absolutely does, Cameron. We really value honest feedback, good or bad, because it helps us understand our customers' experiences and how we can improve. So, thank's again. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what led you to purchase the TruSkin Vitamin C Serum in the first place? What were you hoping to achieve with it?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Uh, sure. So, like I said in the review, I have really sensitive skin. Like, super sensitive. And I also have rosacea, so it's already kind of a tricky situation. I usually stick to, like, a really basic, gentle routine \u2013 just cleanser, a very bland moisturizer, and sunscreen. But I kept seeing, uh, you know, ads, and then a lot of people on TikTok and Instagram, just *rave* about this specific serum. And a lot of them were saying it was actually good for sensitive skin, which really caught my attention. I was hoping, honestly, to just get a brighter, more even skin tone. My rosacea leaves me with a lot of redness, and I have some old acne marks, so I just wanted something to help even things out without, you know, making it worse."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** That makes perfect sense. It sounds like you were really looking for something to address some specific concerns while still being gentle enough for your skin type. And you mentioned seeing positive reviews, particularly about its suitability for sensitive skin. Can you recall if there were any specific claims or ingredients that were highlighted, beyond just \"good for sensitive skin,\" that made you think, \"Okay, this might actually work for me\"?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Hmm, that's a good question. I think\u2026 I remember people talking about how it had hyaluronic acid, which I know is supposed to be hydrating, and Vitamin E, which is an antioxidant. So those sounded good. And everyone just kept saying how \"effective\" it was for brightening and evening tone without being harsh. Like, that was the main selling point for me \u2013 the idea that it could actually *do* something for my skin without, well, causing a meltdown. I was definitely swayed by the sheer volume of positive stories, honestly. It just felt like, \"How could *so many* people be wrong?\""
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** I understand. It's compelling when you see a product get such widespread positive attention, especially when it addresses your specific needs. Before TruSkin, had you tried any other Vitamin C serums, or was this your first venture into that particular active ingredient?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** No, this was actually my first one. I've always been so cautious about introducing anything new, especially actives, because of my rosacea. So, it felt like a pretty big step for me to even try it. I usually just focused on calming and hydrating my skin, and trying to avoid triggers. But, like, my friend, uh, Alex, kept telling me I should try a Vitamin C for the redness. So, I kinda, eventually, got convinced."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** Gotcha. So it was a new category for you, and you were naturally a bit hesitant, which makes your experience all the more impactful, I'm sure. You mentioned in your review that the consistency was \"thin, slightly watery,\" and it \"absorbed quickly.\" Was that what you expected, or did you have a different impression based on the reviews you'd seen?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Yeah, I think that part was actually fine. I mean, a lot of serums are like that, right? I didn't want anything too thick or sticky. So, when I first put it on, I was actually, like, \"Okay, this feels pretty good. It's absorbing nicely.\" It didn't feel heavy. That was probably the only part of the initial application that was, um, exactly as I expected or hoped."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** Right. And then you noted that \"within minutes, my face began to tingle,\" and you described it as more of a \"mild chemical burn\" sensation rather than a \"good active ingredients working\" kind of way. Could you elaborate on the *feeling* difference between those two? How did you distinguish that it was a negative sensation?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Oh, definitely. So, I've used some, like, gentle exfoliating acids before, like a really low-percentage lactic acid, and sometimes you get a little bit of a tingle, but it's like a *fresh* tingle, almost a cooling sensation after a moment. It just feels like it's doing something, you know? This TruSkin serum\u2026 it was different. It felt hot, almost immediately. And it wasn't cooling; it was just a constant, low-level burning. And it just kept going. It felt\u2026 aggressive, I guess is the word. Like my skin was saying, \"Nope, not this.\" It wasn't a gentle hum; it was a blaring alarm."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** That's a very clear distinction, thank you. You applied it at night, after cleansing and before moisturizer, as recommended. Then you woke up to significant redness and irritation. What was your immediate reaction or thought when you saw your skin the next morning?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Honestly? Pure dread. And regret. I mean, I *knew* it was a mistake. My face was just\u2026 angry. Like, an even deeper red than my worst rosacea flare-ups, and it felt so hot and tight. And then the itching started, which is just the worst. And the bumps! I never get bumps on my chin or forehead like that. It just felt like everything I try to avoid with my skincare routine had happened overnight, but, like, supercharged. I immediately thought, \"Okay, stop, this is bad.\""
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** And you did stop, as you mentioned, for a couple of days to let your skin calm down. But then you tried it again, thinking it might have been something else. What prompted you to give it a second chance despite that initial reaction? Was it still the hope, or something else?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Ugh, I know. It sounds so silly now, but yeah, it was partly the hope, partly the price point. Like, for me, $20-$30 is, you know, a decent chunk of change, especially when I'm, like, trying to save up and my income is what it is. I didn't want it to be a waste of money. And also, I don't know, sometimes my skin just reacts weirdly to new things, and then it adjusts. I guess I was telling myself, \"Maybe it was that new laundry detergent, or maybe I ate something weird.\" I just really, really wanted it to work because of all the hype. But then, obviously, it was a terrible decision."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** I appreciate you sharing that, Cameron. It's understandable to want to get value from a purchase and to give a product a fair shot, especially when you've invested in it. When you tried it the second time, was the reaction identical, or did you notice any differences in intensity or how quickly it occurred?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** It was\u2026 it was worse. Definitely worse. The tingling was more intense right away, and it felt like it ramped up much faster. I actually washed it off almost immediately this time because I knew what was coming. But even with that, the redness and irritation just flared up so fast. My skin felt stripped, almost like it was completely dry and flaky in those areas, and just totally compromised. It was like my skin had learned to react even harder."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** That's really valuable to know, that the second reaction was actually more severe. In your review, you specifically called out Witch Hazel as a potential trigger. Is that an ingredient you typically avoid, or one you've reacted to in other products before?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Absolutely. I mean, I'm pretty diligent about checking ingredients because of my rosacea, and Witch Hazel is definitely on my \"no-go\" list. It\u2019s a known astringent, and it just dries out and irritates my skin. I guess I just\u2026 I didn't look close enough at the full ingredient list *before* buying, because I was so focused on the \"sensitive skin friendly\" claims. I just assumed if they were marketing it that way, they wouldn't put something like Witch Hazel so high up. That was my mistake, I guess. But it really highlights how crucial that ingredient list is."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** No, it\u2019s not your mistake, Cameron. It highlights a disconnect in our marketing message versus the product's actual formulation for a segment of our customers, especially those with truly sensitive skin. That's a critical piece of feedback for us. Beyond the skin irritation, you also mentioned the bottle felt \"a bit flimsy\" and the dropper \"wasn't particularly luxurious.\" While these are minor points, did they contribute at all to your overall perception of the product's quality or value?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Uh, yeah, a little bit, I guess. I mean, they're not the main issue, obviously, since my face was literally burning. But it was just, like, another layer of \"meh.\" When you're paying, you know, twenty-something bucks for a serum, you expect it to feel, like, a little nicer. The bottle felt kinda light and plastic-y, not substantial. And the dropper, it worked, but it just felt a little cheap. It was just a small thing that made it feel less premium, especially since I was hoping it would be this amazing, transformative product. So, it kinda added to the disappointment, not just in performance, but in the overall feel."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** I understand. So, the experience with the packaging, while minor, still contributed to the overall impression, especially given your expectations for a \"transformative product.\" If we were to hypothetically reformulate this serum, knowing what you know now, what would be the absolute first ingredient you'd suggest we remove or replace, and why?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Oh, for sure, Witch Hazel. One hundred percent. Like, if you're going to claim it's good for sensitive skin, you absolutely cannot have Witch Hazel, especially not high up on the ingredient list. It's just a recipe for disaster for anyone with reactive skin, rosacea, or even just dry patches. It's counterintuitive to the claims. Maybe find a more gentle, hydrating astringent alternative if that's even necessary, but ideally, just skip it entirely."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** That's incredibly direct and helpful feedback, Cameron. Thank you. Beyond the ingredient formulation, you mentioned the scent being \"slightly artificial and lingering.\" Was that a significant deterrent for you, or just another minor point?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** It wasn't, like, the end of the world, but it definitely didn't help. When your face is already tingling and burning, having a scent that's a bit synthetic and just hangs around makes the whole experience even more unpleasant. It just added to the feeling of \"this isn't natural, this isn't gentle.\" I prefer my skincare to be either unscented or have a very light, natural scent that dissipates quickly. This one just lingered too much."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** Okay, so it amplified the negative sensory experience. That's a good distinction. Looking ahead, if TruSkin were to launch a new, genuinely sensitive-skin-friendly Vitamin C serum, what would be the most important criteria for you to even consider trying it again? What would it need to promise or deliver for you to regain trust?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Wow, that's a tough one, because my trust is pretty, uh, broken right now. But if you *really* want to win me over, it would need to be completely fragrance-free, no Witch Hazel, and honestly, I'd probably need to see some sort of, like, independent certification or, I don't know, a much stronger emphasis on patch testing, or maybe even a money-back guarantee specific to sensitive skin reactions. And a really transparent ingredient list with, like, explanations of why certain ingredients are included or excluded. I'd need proof, basically, that it's genuinely gentle, not just marketing. I'd also probably look for a very stable form of Vitamin C, something that's known to be less irritating."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** That's a very comprehensive list, Cameron, and it makes a lot of sense, especially given your experience. We appreciate you outlining those points. Thinking about your overall pre-TruSkin routine, what kind of products *did* you use for managing redness or uneven tone? Were there any specific brands or ingredients that you found helpful without irritation?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s mostly just focused on calming and repairing. I use a really gentle oat-based cleanser, um, and then a moisturizer with ceramides and niacinamide. Niacinamide has been really good for my redness, actually, without any irritation. I also use a mineral sunscreen every day. So, like, I was hoping the Vitamin C would be, like, the \"next level\" step, you know? But for redness, niacinamide has been the best for me so far. And just keeping things super simple."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** So, niacinamide has been a successful ingredient for you in the past, and you were hoping Vitamin C could complement that. Given everything we've discussed, and knowing how much time and effort it took for your skin to recover, what would you say your overall price-to-value perception is for the TruSkin Vitamin C Serum now?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 34,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Oh, zero. Absolutely zero. I mean, it was a complete waste of money. It didn't just not work; it actively *damaged* my skin. So, I paid, like, twenty-something dollars to have my skin get worse and then spend two weeks fixing it. That\u2019s negative value, honestly. For someone with my income, that money could have gone towards, like, groceries or something actually useful. It was a very expensive and painful lesson."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 35,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** That's a very clear and understandable perspective, Cameron. Thank you for being so candid. If a friend with sensitive skin, perhaps not as sensitive as yours but still prone to reactions, asked you about the TruSkin Vitamin C Serum, what would you tell them?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 36,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** I would tell them to absolutely, unequivocally avoid it. Like, run the other way. Even if they don't have rosacea, if they just have sensitive skin, I would tell them to be extremely careful. I'd specifically warn them about the Witch Hazel and my experience, and say that the \"sensitive skin friendly\" claims are, like, really misleading. I'd tell them it's just not worth the risk, or the pain, or the recovery time. There are other Vitamin C serums out there, and I'd recommend they look into those instead, or just stick to other ingredients like niacinamide."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 37,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** That's a very strong caution, and important for us to hear. Just one final question, Cameron. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is \"extremely dissatisfied\" and 10 is \"extremely satisfied,\" how would you rate your overall satisfaction with the TruSkin Vitamin C Serum, based on your entire experience?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 38,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Oh, uh\u2026 Definitely a 1. A very strong 1. I mean, it was, as I titled my review, an utter nightmare. My skin is still a bit weird from it, honestly."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 39,
      "speaker": "**Mike",
      "text": "** Cameron, thank you again. Your feedback, though difficult to hear, is incredibly important for us. It gives us a very clear picture of where we need to improve, especially regarding our product formulations and marketing claims for sensitive skin. We really appreciate your honesty and time today."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 40,
      "speaker": "**Cameron",
      "text": "** Yeah, no problem. I just hope, like, it actually helps prevent someone else from having the same experience."
