      "text": "Good morning, Victoria. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Sarah, and I\u2019m a customer experience representative here at Cosori. I understand you recently posted a review about your Pro II Air Fryer Oven Combo, and we really appreciate you bringing your concerns to our attention. We take all feedback seriously, especially regarding safety, and I wanted to personally reach out to gather more details about your experience."

      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Good morning, Sarah. Uh, yeah, no problem. I appreciate you reaching out. Honestly, I wasn't expecting a call, so\u2026 yeah."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 3,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I can certainly understand that. Your review was quite detailed, and frankly, very concerning, Victoria. The safety of our customers is our absolute top priority, and what you described with the popping sound, the burning smell, and smoke is something we absolutely need to investigate thoroughly. To start, could you perhaps walk me through your initial purchase decision? What led you to choose the Cosori Pro II model specifically?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Hmm, well, you know, I\u2019d been seeing a lot of buzz about air fryers, especially on social media. My friends were raving about how convenient they were, and, um, honestly, I was looking for a healthier way to cook. I\u2019m a therapist, and my days can be pretty long and unpredictable, so convenience is a huge factor for me. I wanted something that could make quick meals, you know, without a lot of oil. I did some research online, compared a few models\u2026 The Cosori Pro II seemed to have good reviews overall, and I liked the larger capacity, the 5.8 quart, because I figured it would be versatile enough for different types of meals. Price was also a consideration, obviously. I mean, it wasn\u2019t the cheapest, but it wasn\u2019t the most expensive either, and I thought it offered good value for the features."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That makes a lot of sense, especially wanting that blend of convenience and healthier options for your busy schedule. Did you consider any other specific brands or models that stood out during your research, or was Cosori the one that really caught your eye from the start?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Oh, yeah, definitely. I looked at Ninja, I think, and Philips. They were a bit more expensive, and honestly, the Cosori just seemed to hit that sweet spot between features and cost for me. I saw it on Amazon, and it had a lot of positive reviews at the time, which, you know, swayed me. I figured a well-regarded brand with a lot of sales would be reliable. I really just wanted something that would work well for things like, um, chicken, vegetables, maybe some frozen items. Before this, I was mostly using my regular oven or, you know, just pan-frying things, which can be messy and, well, less healthy."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I understand. And it sounds like you had very clear expectations for what an air fryer could bring to your kitchen. You mentioned in your review that from the very first use, you noticed a strong chemical smell. Could you elaborate on that a bit? What did it smell like exactly, and how long did it really persist for you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Oh, it was\u2026 distinct. Not like burning food, more like\u2026 hot plastic, maybe, or something artificial. I initially tried to tell myself it was just the \"new appliance smell,\" like when you get a new car or something, you know? But it was strong. I ran it empty a few times, hoping it would burn off, like the manual suggested, but it just\u2026 didn't. It diminished slightly over a week or so, but every time I used it, that smell would come back, especially when it got really hot. It was always there, kind of lingering in the background, which in hindsight, was really a warning sign, wasn't it?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "It certainly sounds like it became a noticeable and recurring issue, which is definitely not ideal. And you also mentioned some performance issues, like the chicken coming out rubbery and fries being inconsistently cooked. Can you tell me more about your typical cooking process? Were you following specific recipes or using the preset functions, and how often were you using the air fryer before the incident?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Yeah, I tried both! I used the presets for fries and chicken initially. You know, just throwing in some frozen fries or some seasoned chicken thighs. But they never came out right. The chicken was rubbery, like I said, even when I adjusted the time and temperature. And the fries\u2026 they were the worst. Some parts burnt, some parts still soggy. I tried preheating, shaking the basket, spreading them out, everything I could think of. I even looked up some online tips specific to air frying. Nothing seemed to make a consistent difference. I was probably using it, hmm, I'd say maybe three to four times a week. It was supposed to be my go-to for quick dinners."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "So, even with adjustments and trying different methods, the results were consistently disappointing. That must have been frustrating, especially when you were looking for that convenience. And then, there was the digital display issue. You called it a \"minor annoyance\" but a \"red flag.\" How often was it unresponsive, and which commands were you having trouble with?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Oh, the digital display\u2026 *sighs* Yeah, it was a minor annoyance that just\u2026 piled on. Probably half the time I used it, I\u2019d have to press the buttons multiple times. Like, I\u2019d try to set the temperature or the time, and it just wouldn't register. I'd press it, nothing, press it again, still nothing, and then maybe on the third or fourth press, it would finally take. It wasn\u2019t just one button, it was generally any of them. It felt\u2026 flimsy, almost. Like the touch sensor wasn't really, um, sensitive enough. At the time, I just thought, \"Oh, it's a budget air fryer, maybe the display isn't top-tier,\" but now\u2026 yeah, it feels like it was part of a larger pattern of poor quality."

      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That\u2019s incredibly valuable feedback, Victoria. It helps us understand the full user experience, not just the critical incident. Now, moving to that critical incident you described, when you were air frying frozen fish fillets. Could you tell me more about that moment? Where were you in the kitchen, what exactly happened when you heard the popping sound, and what were your immediate thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Okay, so it was last week. I, um, I can\u2019t remember the exact day, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday. I was making dinner for myself, just some frozen breaded fish fillets, nothing complicated. I\u2019d done them a few times before, so it was a pretty routine task. The air fryer was on my kitchen counter, right next to the sink. I was actually just, uh, folding laundry in the living room, which is right off the kitchen, so I was nearby. All of a sudden, I heard this *loud* pop. It was really distinct, like a firecracker, but inside the appliance. And almost immediately, maybe a second or two later, this really acrid, strong burning plastic smell hit me. It wasn't the usual chemical smell; this was much more intense and alarming. My heart just jumped."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I can only imagine how startling and terrifying that must have been. So you heard the pop, immediately smelled burning plastic\u2026 what was your very next action?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "My very next action was to just bolt into the kitchen. I saw smoke, like a wisp, coming from the back of the unit, near where the fan vent is. It wasn't a huge cloud of smoke, but it was definitely there, and that burning smell was just overpowering the kitchen. I immediately reached for the plug and pulled it out. My first thought was just *get it unplugged*. It was on my counter, right under my cabinets, and all I could think was, \"Oh my God, this could start a fire.\" It felt incredibly hot, even after I unplugged it. I didn't dare touch it much, just the plug. When I looked closely at the back, where the smoke was coming from, I could actually see\u2026 like, melted plastic inside the vent area. It was distorted and kinda gooey. It was just\u2026 shocking. And I was alone. What if I hadn't been home?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That\u2019s a truly frightening scenario, Victoria, and you absolutely did the right thing by immediately unplugging it. Seeing melted plastic and smoke from an appliance, especially one that uses heat, is a serious safety concern, and I want to assure you we're taking this very, very seriously. Have you had any similar experiences with other kitchen appliances in the past, or was this a completely new and alarming situation for you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "No, absolutely not. I mean, I\u2019ve had appliances break down, sure, but never anything like this. Never where there was smoke, a popping sound, and clear evidence of melting plastic. This felt\u2026 dangerous. Like a genuine fire risk. My other appliances, like my microwave or toaster, they\u2019ve just stopped working, or a button broke, but nothing that felt like it was going to spontaneously combust on my countertop. This was a completely new and, frankly, terrifying experience. It really shook me up for a few days afterward, just thinking about the \"what if.\""
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "And after this incident, you mentioned you tried to contact customer service. Could you tell me a bit more about that experience? What were the wait times like, and what was the nature of the responses you received?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Oh, that was another layer of frustration, honestly. I called, and the wait times were just\u2026 really long. I was on hold for ages, I think over 20 minutes each time I tried, which, when you're already upset and busy, is just annoying. When I finally got through, the person I spoke to, um, they seemed to be just following a script. They asked me to describe the problem, which I did, and then they just said I needed to send the unit back for inspection. I tried to explain that I was really uncomfortable doing that. I mean, it\u2019s a potentially fire-damaged appliance, right? I didn't want to package it up and send it through the mail, possibly exposing someone else to a hazard, or it breaking open during transit. I wanted assurances, you know, maybe a special return process for safety incidents, or a replacement *before* sending it back, but they just kept repeating the same instruction. It felt really unhelpful and almost dismissive of the seriousness of the situation. It made me feel like they didn't really grasp the gravity of a fire hazard."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I hear you, Victoria. That's completely understandable to feel that way, and I sincerely apologize that your experience with our customer service team added to your distress rather than alleviating it. We will certainly review our protocols for handling safety-related returns. Given everything that\u2019s happened, what are your thoughts on air frying now? Has this experience changed your perception of air fryers or even other countertop appliances in general?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Hmm, that\u2019s a good question. I think\u2026 it\u2019s definitely made me more wary, that\u2019s for sure. I still think the *idea* of an air fryer is great \u2013 the convenience, the healthier cooking. But this experience has shattered my trust in the specific brand, and honestly, it\u2019s made me question the overall quality control in appliance manufacturing. I mean, two months? That\u2019s just unacceptable. I\u2019m definitely going to be much more scrutinizing when I buy any new appliance now. I probably won\u2019t buy another Cosori product, that much I can say. I\u2019ll look for brands with a reputation for absolute reliability and safety, even if it means paying a bit more. I\u2019d rather pay for peace of mind than deal with another scare like this."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "That\u2019s a very clear message, and we appreciate your honesty. If we were to somehow address all of your safety concerns and ensure a reliable, consistently performing product, what would be the single most important improvement you would suggest for the Cosori Pro II, beyond just fixing the malfunction? Thinking back to those initial few weeks, what would have made it a truly excellent product for you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Beyond the, you know, fire hazard\u2026 *chuckles sardonically*\u2026 I guess it would be consistency in cooking. That was my biggest frustration initially. If the chicken came out perfectly crispy and juicy, and the fries were golden and evenly cooked every single time, without me having to guess or constantly adjust, that would have been amazing. The display could have been more responsive too, but really, the core function of cooking food well and reliably is key. Maybe better heat distribution or a more powerful fan? I don't know the technical details, but just, um, better results. And of course, no chemical smell from day one!"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Excellent points, Victoria. Consistent cooking results and a better user interface are definitely areas we continuously work to refine. You mentioned price was a factor in your initial purchase. Given your overall experience, how do you now perceive the value you received for the price you paid for the Cosori Pro II?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Oh, zero value. Negative value, even. I mean, I paid, what was it, around $120-$130? For something that lasted two months and almost set my kitchen on fire? That's a complete waste of money. Honestly, it feels like I paid to be scared. If it had worked perfectly, delivered on its promises, cooked food consistently, I would have been happy with that price. It would have felt like a good investment for my lifestyle. But as it stands, it\u2019s just\u2026 trash. I have to dispose of it, I lost my money, and I gained anxiety. So, yeah, the value perception is pretty much in the gutter."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I fully understand your frustration with that outcome, Victoria. It's a significant investment, and it absolutely should have delivered on its promises. Finally, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being extremely dissatisfied and 10 being extremely satisfied, how would you rate your overall experience with Cosori, taking into account the product, the malfunction, and your customer service interaction?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "Hmm\u2026 a 1. Definitely a 1. Maybe a 0 if that were an option. The product failed dangerously, the initial performance was subpar, and the customer service was unhelpful. It\u2019s just been a completely negative experience from start to finish. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I'd actively tell people to avoid it."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Thank you for being so candid, Victoria. Your feedback is incredibly important to us, and I truly appreciate you sharing your detailed experience. We are going to ensure this information is escalated immediately to our product safety and development teams for thorough investigation. I'll also be sure to share your feedback regarding customer service training. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or any other concerns you have that we haven't covered today?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "Victoria",
      "text": "I don't think so. I just\u2026 I hope something comes of this. I really do. I don't want anyone else to go through what I did. It\u2019s just not right."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
