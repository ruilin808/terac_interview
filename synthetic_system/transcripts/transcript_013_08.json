      "text": "** Hi Victoria, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Sarah, and I\u2019m a representative from TIJN. We really appreciate you sharing your feedback with us through your online review, and we wanted to follow up directly to understand your experience even better. Is this still a good time for you?"
    },

      "turnId": 2,

      "text": "** Hi Sarah, yes, absolutely. Thank you for reaching out. I\u2019m happy to chat."

      "turnId": 3,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** Wonderful. To start, could you just quickly confirm that you purchased our TIJN Blue Light Blocking Glasses, the square nerd eyeglasses frame, a few months ago?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 4,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** That\u2019s right, yes. The matte black ones. I think I got them maybe, oh gosh, I want to say about four months ago now? Give or take a week or two."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 5,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** Perfect. And just to confirm, you\u2019re currently working as a therapist, correct?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 6,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Yes, that\u2019s right. I specialize in family therapy, and I do a mix of in-person and a good amount of tele-health sessions, plus all the administrative stuff and notes, of course."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 7,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** Got it, thank you for clarifying. Your review mentioned a significant amount of screen time impacting your eyes. Could you tell me a little more about what your daily screen usage looks like in your role as a therapist? What kinds of tasks are you typically doing on screens?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 8,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Oh, absolutely. Well, beyond the actual virtual sessions, which can be anywhere from two to five hours a day depending on my schedule, there\u2019s just so much documentation. You know, writing up notes after each session, preparing for future sessions, doing research for specific client needs, updating client files, and then all the general emails and communication. And honestly, sometimes in the evenings, I\u2019m just trying to decompress by watching a show or something, so it adds up to a *lot* of hours. Before these glasses, it was just constant strain, like a gritty feeling, and those awful migraines."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 9,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That sounds incredibly demanding. You mentioned you were \"desperate for relief.\" What had you tried before you decided to purchase blue light blocking glasses?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 10,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Hmm, good question. Before these, I tried to be more mindful of taking breaks, doing the 20-20-20 rule, you know, looking away every 20 minutes. I tried eye drops for the dryness, which helped a little, but it was just a temporary fix. I even adjusted my monitor settings, tried different lighting in my office. But nothing really seemed to cut through the underlying fatigue and the feeling that my eyes were just constantly overworked. The migraines were the worst, though. Those really disrupted my ability to work or even just live normally."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 11,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** It sounds like you exhausted quite a few conventional solutions. When you were looking for blue light glasses, what specifically drew you to the TIJN square frames compared to other options you might have seen online?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 12,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Well, a few things. First, the style. I wanted something that looked professional enough for my virtual sessions. I mean, my clients see me through the screen, and I don't want to look like I just rolled out of bed, you know? The square frames with the matte black finish really caught my eye \u2013 they looked chic and kind of intelligent without being overly flashy. I also really liked that \"subtly nerdy\" vibe I mentioned in the review. And honestly, the price point was a huge factor. As a therapist, especially early in my private practice, every dollar counts, and these were incredibly budget-friendly compared to some of the other brands I saw that were two, three, even four times the price."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 13,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That makes perfect sense. Aesthetics and affordability are definitely key considerations for many. You mentioned the packaging was \"modest\" but your initial assessment of the frames themselves was positive. Could you elaborate a bit on your first impressions when you took them out of the soft pouch?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 14,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Sure. The packaging itself was just\u2026 a pouch and a cloth. No big fancy box, which is fine, but it was noticeable. When I took the glasses out though, I was really pleasantly surprised. They *do* look more expensive than they are. The matte black finish is smooth, and the lines are really clean. They felt very light, which was good because I was worried about them feeling heavy on my nose after a long day. And the hinges seemed\u2026 solid enough. Not super high-end, obviously, but not flimsy to the point where I thought they\u2019d break right away. I put them on, and immediately thought, \"Okay, these look good.\""
    },
    {
      "turnId": 15,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That\u2019s great to hear. Now, shifting to the user experience, you immediately noticed the yellow tint. You described it as a \"mild, warm hue.\" Can you walk me through your adjustment period? Did it take long to get used to?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 16,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Oh, absolutely. It was definitely noticeable right away. My white screen suddenly looked creamy, like an old newspaper or something. My initial thought was, \"Oh, this is going to be annoying.\" But honestly, I adjusted to it surprisingly quickly. Within a day, maybe two, it just became the new normal for my screen. My brain just filtered it out, I guess. In fact, after that initial phase, I started to really appreciate it. It made the screen feel\u2026 softer. Less harsh, definitely. My eyes just didn't have to work as hard against that bright blue-white."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 17,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That's really interesting how quickly you adapted. You did mention, however, that the tint became an issue for \"any task involving visual materials where precise color is crucial.\" Could you give me some specific examples of those kinds of tasks in your profession where you felt the need to take the glasses off?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 18,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Hmm, yeah. So for most of my note-taking and reading, it\u2019s totally fine. But sometimes, when I'm reviewing research, there might be infographics or charts with specific color coding that I need to interpret accurately. Or, some clients might share creative work with me \u2013 like artwork or digital projects \u2013 as part of their therapeutic process, and for those, I really want to see the true colors, you know? Even just something simple like trying to pick out an outfit online for myself, or if I'm looking at, um, something for my home. Those are the times I find myself instinctively reaching up to take them off for a moment. It\u2019s not constant, but it *does* happen."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 19,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** I understand. It sounds like those are specific, intermittent needs rather than a pervasive problem during your core work. On the flip side, you highlighted the \"most significant benefit\" as the noticeable reduction in eye strain and headaches. Could you quantify that for me, if possible? For example, how frequently were you experiencing migraines before, and how has that changed since using the glasses?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 20,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Oh, wow, that\u2019s a great question. Before, it was\u2026 crippling. Seriously. I was getting migraines probably once every two to three weeks, sometimes even more frequently if I had a particularly heavy screen-time week. And when they hit, they were debilitating. I\u2019d lose a whole day, sometimes two. Since wearing these glasses, I can honestly say I've only had maybe one, *maybe* two, really significant migraines in the past four months. And even those felt less intense, almost like they were trying to start but didn't quite get there. The constant eye strain and gritty feeling? That's almost completely gone. It\u2019s like night and day."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 21,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That\u2019s incredibly impactful feedback, Victoria. It really speaks to the core function of the product. You also mentioned feeling that the reduced blue light exposure helps you transition to sleep more easily. Can you expand on that a bit?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 22,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Yeah, I think so. I wouldn't say I just put them on and BAM, I'm asleep. That's not it. But I do wear them in the evenings if I'm still on my laptop or even just scrolling on my phone a bit. What I've noticed is that my eyes just feel generally calmer, less \"wired\" or stimulated. It\u2019s easier to just put the screen away and feel like my brain can start winding down. It\u2019s a more gentle transition, I guess. Before, it felt like my eyes were still buzzing from the screen, making it harder to relax. Now, I feel that sense of calm and less visual stimulation, which definitely helps with the overall unwinding process."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 23,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That subtle but significant shift sounds very beneficial for your overall well-being. And in terms of comfort, you described them as excellent, wearing them for hours without pressure points. Are there any particular features about the fit or design that contribute to that comfort?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 24,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Definitely their weight. Or rather, lack of it. They are so lightweight. I've had glasses before, even just sunglasses, that start to pinch behind my ears or leave marks on my nose after a while. With these, I genuinely forget I'm wearing them. I wear them for six, seven, eight hours straight sometimes during my workday, and I never feel that pressure. They just kind of... disappear on my face. And they fit well, too. They don't slide down my nose or feel loose. They just stay put."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 25,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That's high praise for long-term wear. Now, you rated us a 4 out of 5 stars, and you mentioned the slight tint and the lightweight plastic's durability as reasons for not giving a full five. Could you tell me if you've experienced any specific durability issues or if that's more of a general concern given the material?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 26,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** It\u2019s more of a general concern, honestly. I haven't had them break or anything. But because they're so light, they just *feel* like if I dropped them on a hard floor, or if they got sat on, they'd probably be done for. I'm pretty careful with them, so it hasn\u2019t been an issue yet. But I know for a fact that a more expensive, sturdier pair would probably withstand more accidental abuse. It\u2019s just the trade-off, right? For the price, I can't really complain, but it\u2019s definitely something I'm conscious of. And the extremely subtle internal reflection I mentioned? I still notice it sometimes, but it's truly so minor, it barely warrants mentioning. It's just there *sometimes* if the light hits it just right."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 27,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** Understood. So, it's more about perceived robustness than actual failure you've experienced. Given your experience, if you were to imagine the \"perfect\" blue light blocking glasses for someone in your profession, what features would they have? What would make these a five-star product for you?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 28,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Oh, that's a fun thought. Okay, so obviously keeping the effectiveness of the blue light blocking \u2013 that's non-negotiable. The style is great too, I wouldn't change that. But for me, the ideal would be\u2026 glasses with that amazing comfort and effectiveness, but with little to no visible tint. Or maybe, hear me out, a technology that could dynamically adjust the tint depending on what you're looking at? That's probably super futuristic, but if I'm dreaming! [laughs] Failing that, just a really, truly clear lens that still blocks blue light. And then, a slightly more robust frame material, but without adding significant weight or bumping the price point too high. That's a tall order, I know, but that would be perfect."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 29,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** [laughs] No, that\u2019s exactly the kind of forward-thinking feedback we appreciate, Victoria. It helps us understand where the technology could go. Following up on that, is there anything that would make you consider switching to a competitor's product right now?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 30,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Hmm, right now? Probably not, honestly. These have been such a game-changer for my eye strain and migraines, and the price was so good. I\u2019m pretty happy. What *would* make me switch, though, would be if another brand offered a similar level of effectiveness and comfort, but with significantly less or no tint, and *still* managed to keep it in a similar affordable price range. Or, if these ones suddenly became wildly expensive. But as they are now, for the value, they\u2019re pretty hard to beat. I'm not actively looking to switch, let's put it that way."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 31,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That\u2019s fantastic to hear. You also said in your review that you would \"highly recommend\" these. Who specifically do you think would benefit most from these glasses?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 32,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Anyone who spends a lot of time on screens, really. But especially people in professions similar to mine, or teachers, or students, anyone who has long hours in front of a computer. If you\u2019re getting that constant eye fatigue, dry eyes, or screen-induced headaches, and you\u2019re on a budget, these are a no-brainer. I've actually told a few of my colleagues about them already. I mean, for the price, it\u2019s such a low-risk way to try and get some genuine relief."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 33,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** That\u2019s a very clear endorsement, Victoria. Just one final question for me today. Based on your entire experience with the TIJN Blue Light Blocking Glasses, from the purchase to using them daily, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is \"extremely dissatisfied\" and 10 is \"extremely satisfied,\" what would be your overall satisfaction rating?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 34,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** Oh, that\u2019s easy. I\u2019d give them a strong 8.5, maybe even a 9. They\u2019ve genuinely made a huge difference in my daily comfort and well-being. The tint is the only thing holding it back from a perfect 10, but even that is pretty minor for most of my work. They really deliver on their promise."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 35,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** Thank you so much, Victoria. That\u2019s incredibly valuable feedback for us, and we truly appreciate your honesty and time today. Your insights are going to be very helpful as we continue to improve our products. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or any other questions for me?"
    },
    {
      "turnId": 36,
      "speaker": "**Victoria",
      "text": "** No, I think we covered everything. Thanks for listening! It\u2019s nice to know companies actually pay attention to reviews."
    },
    {
      "turnId": 37,
      "speaker": "**Sarah",
      "text": "** We certainly do! Thank you again, Victoria. Enjoy the rest of your day."
